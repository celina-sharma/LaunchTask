    "text": "Dear Fellow Shareholder,\nWe are pleased to provide you an update on the progress of your investments in ACRES\nCommercial Realty Corp. (\u201cACR\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d). During the past year, our manager has\ncontinued to make progress on the core tenets of its responsibilities to manage the existing assets\nin the portfolio, originate new loan assets, facilitate the financing of the assets, and control costs\nto drive earnings and increase book value per share. We are pleased to report that substantial\nprogress has been made on all fronts and we remain focused on these mandates going forward.\nThe ACRES team continued to diligently manage our assets and provide exceptional service for\nour borrowers. We worked proactively with these borrowers to address their needs so that they\ncould maintain payments on their loans. These efforts have resulted in a high-quality, stabilized\nbook to build on.\nWe are proud of the success we achieved in 2022 and are optimistic in our ability to deliver\nshareholder value over the long term.\nSelective Growth & Attractive Financing Vehicles\nDuring 2022, we selectively grew the Company\u2019s loan portfolio by leveraging ACRES\u2019s\ncomplementary lending pipeline and network of sponsor relationships. We are pleased to note that\nwe closed over $610 million of commercial real estate first-mortgage commitments in 2022.\nAdditionally, we carefully pursued opportunities to make direct equity investments in real estate\nin 2022, ultimately acquiring two properties for a total of $51.6 million. We expect that these\ninvestments may yield enhanced returns in the long term that, we will be able to substantially\nshield from taxes due to the existence of ACR\u2019s considerable tax assets and ultimately reinvest\ninto the loan origination pipeline.\nWe recognize that building on this momentum is essential. Therefore, the ACRES team is vigilant\nin identifying and executing on opportunities to grow asset-specific financing with duration at\nattractive coupon rates that can raise our capacity to originate loans. In addition, we have the\nreinvestment window available on our two ACR securitizations through May 2023 and December\n2023. The bulk of the Company\u2019s current portfolio was originated in 2021 and 2022, comprising\n84% of the current par balance and have initial maturities of 2024 or later and extended maturities\nof 2026 or later.\nPortfolio Stability\nThe ACRES asset management team prides itself on its ability to tailor solutions that will keep\nborrowers on track despite challenges that may arise. Current volatility and uncertainty in the\nmarket have proved to be such challenges, but ones we\u2019ve been able to manage as a result of our\nproactive asset management approach.\nThanks to our asset management team, we\u2019ve reduced our watch list to 5% of the loan portfolio at\nthe end of 2022, down from 8% at the end of 2021. In January 2023, one watch list loan, a hotel\nportfolio in the southwest region with a par value of $56.5 million was paid off in full, which\nreduced the value of our watch list loans in half as compared to year end 2022.",

    "text": "As of December 31, 2022, 95% of the loan portfolio was performing in line or near underwritten\nexpectations and a significant majority of loans were current on contractual payments, which is an\nimprovement from 92% at December 31, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2022, 100% of our loan portfolio by carrying value earned a floating rate of\ninterest and was financed entirely with liabilities that both pay interest at floating rates.\nAdditionally, 89% of the par value of our floating-rate loan portfolio was covered by borrower-\nowned interest rate caps that provided additional credit protection to the Company in the current\nrising interest rate environment.\nCapital Markets Flexibility\nWe worked closely with our lenders and executed as planned to provide the Company maximum\nflexibility given the challenging business environment in 2022.\nWe finalized terms with Mass Mutual under its non-mark-to-market agreement to upsize the\ncommitment and to provide for individual loan series that will each have a five-year term from the\ndate of issuance. Additionally, we have warehouse lines open with JPM and Morgan Stanley, each\ncollateralized by performing loans and each with excess capacity to support future originations.\nIn August 2022, we repaid the remaining outstanding 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes upon\nmaturity at par.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 849,000 shares of common stock at an\naverage price of $10.35, which contributed $1.32 per share to common stock book value since we\nwere able to repurchase the shares at prices significantly below our common stock book value.\nCommon stock book value was $24.54 at December 31, 2022, up 3% from December 31, 2021.\nCorporate Responsibility\nIn undertaking our ESG strategy, we are particularly focused on identifying and executing\nprograms that ensure our dedication to diversity and inclusion and emphasize ethical behavior.\nWe are committed to integrating ESG policies and practices into our operational, investment and\ndevelopment strategies to build a sustainable future.\nDuring 2022, we announced a new initiative called \u201cACRES Protects an Acre\u201d initiative, in which\nACRES will make a donation in connection with each loan it closes to a nonprofit organization\nwhose mission is to protect acres of vulnerable land. Additionally, early in 2023, we announced a\npartnership with Project Destined, an organization that provides training in financial literacy,\nentrepreneurship, and real estate to students from underserved communities.\nLooking Ahead\nAs we look ahead to 2023, we have established a goal to get the Company fully invested to drive\nmeaningful earnings that can be re-invested back into the loan origination pipeline. We expect our\naccomplishments in 2022 will help to pave the way to attaining that goal.",

    "text": "PART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral\nWe are a Maryland corporation, incorporated in 2005, and a real estate finance company that is organized and conducts our\noperations to qualify as a real estate investment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d) for federal income tax purposes under Subchapter M of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. On February 16, 2021, we amended our certificate of incorporation to change our\nname to ACRES Commercial Realty Corp. from Exantas Capital Corp. Our investment strategy is primarily focused on originating,\nholding and managing commercial real estate (\u201cCRE\u201d) mortgage loans and equity investments in commercial real estate property\nthrough direct ownership and joint ventures. We are externally managed by ACRES Capital, LLC (our \u201cManager\u201d) a subsidiary of\nACRES Capital Corp. (collectively \u201cACRES\u201d), a private commercial real estate lender exclusively dedicated to nationwide middle\nmarket CRE lending with a focus on multifamily, student housing, hospitality, industrial and office property in top United States, or\nU.S., markets. Our Manager draws upon the management team of ACRES and its collective investment experience to provide its\nservices.\nOur objective is to provide our stockholders with total returns over time, including the payment of quarterly distributions when\napproved by our board of directors, (our \u201cBoard\u201d) and capital appreciation, while seeking to manage the risks associated with our\ninvestment strategies. We finance a substantial portion of our portfolio investments through borrowing strategies seeking to match the\nmaturities and repricing dates of our financings with the maturities and repricing dates of our investments.\nOur investment strategy targets the following CRE credit investments, including:\n\u2022 Floating-rate first mortgage loans, which we refer to as whole loans;\n\u2022 First priority interests in first mortgage loans, which we refer to as A-notes;\n\u2022 Subordinated interests in first mortgage loans, which we refer to as B-notes;\n\u2022 Preferred equity investments related to CRE that are subordinate to first mortgage loans and are not collateralized by the\nproperty underlying the investment; and\n\u2022 CRE equity investments.\nWe generate our income primarily from the spread between the revenues we receive from our assets and the cost to finance our\nownership of those assets, including corporate debt.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) was identified. The resulting spread of COVID-19 throughout\nthe globe led the World Health Organization to designate COVID-19 as a pandemic and numerous countries, including the U.S, to\ndeclare national emergencies. Many countries responded to the initial and ensuing outbreaks of COVID-19 by instituting quarantines\nand restrictions on travel and limiting operations of non-essential offices and retail centers, which resulted in the closure or remote\noperation of non-essential businesses and increased rates of unemployment and market disruption in connection with the economic\nuncertainty. While the U.S. and certain countries around the world have eased restrictions and financial markets and unemployment\nrates have stabilized to some degree, the pandemic continues to cause uncertainty in the U.S. and global economies, generally, and the\nCRE industry in particular.\nThe aforementioned quarantines and travel restrictions contributed significantly to economic disruptions across the country\nthat directly impacted our borrowers and their ability to pay and to stay current with their debt obligations in 2019 and 2020, causing\nsignificant increases in our provisions for credit losses.

During this height of the pandemic, we used a variety of legal and structural\noptions to manage credit risk effectively, including through forbearance and extension provisions or agreements. As of December 31,\n2022, we have substantially reversed those provisions due to significant improvements in our current and expected macroeconomic\noperating environments as well as due to improvements in collateral operating performance and market liquidity.\nWe continue to actively and responsibly manage corporate liquidity and operations in light of the market disruptions caused by\nCOVID-19. However, it is inherently difficult to accurately assess the continuing impact of the pandemic as well as other domestic or\nglobal events on our revenues, profitability and financial position. In response, we are focused on maintaining sufficient liquidity while\nstill growing our loan origination business. We continuously monitor the effects of domestic and global events on our operations and\nfinancial position to ensure that we remain responsive and adaptable to the dynamic changes in our operating environment.\nThe negative impact of COVID-19 on our commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, investments and 2020 results\ncreated a net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards and net capital loss carryforwards (\u201cCLCFs\u201d). Our 2020 tax return, completed in\nOctober 2021, resulted in NOL carryforwards of $47.7 million and CLCFs of $136.9 million, including net capital loss carryforwards\n5",

Our 2021 tax return, completed in October 2022, resulted in NOL\nutilization of $1.1 million and CLCF utilization of $15.0 million. Additionally, we have NOL carryforwards of $60.1 million and CLCFs\nof $1.0 million at our taxable REIT subsidiaries (\u201cTRSs\u201d).\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have acquired equity investments in CRE properties to utilize CLCFs in our QRSs. These equity\ninvestments offer the opportunity for enhanced capital appreciation returns that may be reinvested into the loan origination pipeline\nwhen and if realized.\nWe typically target transitional floating-rate CRE loans between $10.0 million and $100.0 million. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 we originated 19 CRE loans with total commitments of $610.8 million. At December 31, 2022, our CRE loan\nportfolio comprised $2.1 billion of floating-rate CRE whole loans with a weighted average spread of 3.78% over the one-month\nbenchmark interest rates utilized, which have a weighted average floor of 0.68%, excluding one whole loan without a benchmark floor.\nAdditionally, our CRE loan portfolio comprised one fully reserved $4.7 million mezzanine loan at December 31, 2022.\nOur Business Strategy\nThe core components of our business strategy are:\nInvestment in CRE assets. We are currently invested in CRE whole loans, CRE mezzanine loans and CRE investments. Our\ngoal is to allocate 90% to 100% of our equity to our CRE assets.\nManaging our investment portfolio. At December 31, 2022, we managed $2.1 billion of assets, including $1.5 billion of assets\nthat were financed and held in variable interest entities. The core of our management process is credit analysis, which our Manager,\nwith the assistance of ACRES, uses to actively monitor our existing investments and as a basis for evaluating new investments. Senior\nmanagement of ACRES has extensive experience in underwriting the credit risk associated with our targeted asset classes and conducts\ndetailed due diligence on all investments. After we make investments, our Manager actively monitors them for early detection of trouble\nor deterioration.

We have established investment policies, procedures and guidelines that are reviewed and approved by\nour Manager\u2019s investment committee and our Board. The investment committee and/or our Board, as applicable, meets regularly to\nconsider and approve proposed specific investments. Our Board monitors the execution of our overall investment strategies and targeted\nasset classes. We acquire our investments primarily for income. We do not have a policy that requires us to focus our investments in\none or more particular geographic areas or industries.\nFinancing policies. We use leverage in order to increase potential returns to our stockholders and for financing our portfolio.\nWe do not speculate on changes in interest rates. Although we have identified leverage targets for each of our targeted asset classes, our\ninvestment policies do not have any minimum or maximum leverage limits. Our Manager\u2019s investment committee has the discretion,\nwithout the need for further approval by our Board, to increase the amount of leverage we incur above our targeted range for individual\nasset classes subject, however, to any leverage constraints that may be imposed by existing financing arrangements.\nWe use borrowing and securitization strategies to accomplish our long-term match funding financing strategy. Based upon\ncurrent conditions in the credit markets for collateralized debt obligations and collateralized loan obligations (sometimes, collectively,\nreferred to as CDOs and CLOs) we expect to modestly increase leverage through new CRE debt securitizations and the continued use\nof our senior secured financing facility and term financing facilities. We may also seek other credit arrangements to finance new\ninvestments that we believe can generate attractive risk-adjusted returns, subject to availability.\nCredit and risk management policies. Our Manager focuses its attention on credit and risk assessment from the earliest stage\nof the investment selection process.

In a business environment where benchmark interest rates are\nincreasing significantly, cash flows of the CRE assets underlying our loans may not be sufficient to pay debt service on our loans, which\ncould result in non-performance or default. We partially mitigate this risk by generally requiring our borrowers to purchase interest rate\ncap agreements with non-affiliated, well-capitalized third parties and by selectively requiring our borrowers to have and maintain debt\nservice reserves. These interest rate caps generally mature prior to the maturity date of the loan and the borrowers are required to pay to\nextend them. In most cases the sponsors will need to fund additional equity into the properties to cover these costs as the property may\nnot generate sufficient cash flow to pay these costs. At December 31, 2022, 88.8% of the par value of our CRE loan portfolio had interest\nrate caps in place with a weighted-average maturity of 1.1 years.\nHistorically, we have used the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as the benchmark interest rate for our floating-rate\nwhole loans and we have been exposed to LIBOR through our floating-rate borrowings. Many of our floating-rate whole loans, CRE\nsecuritizations and term warehouse financing facilities included one-month LIBOR as the original contractual benchmark interest rate.\nOur unsecured junior subordinated debentures use three-month LIBOR as the contractual benchmark interest rate. In March 2021, the\nUnited Kingdom\u2019s, or U.K.\u2019s, Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) announced that it would cease publication of the one-week and the\ntwo-month USD LIBOR immediately after December 31, 2021, and cease publication of the remaining tenors immediately after June\n30, 2023. In July 2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee\ncomprising large U.S. financial institutions, has identified Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its preferred alternative rate\nfor LIBOR.\nAll variable rate loans originated by us beginning January 1, 2022 have been benchmarked to SOFR. Additionally, all of our\nfloating-rate whole loans contain provisions that provide for the transition of the contractual benchmark interest rate to an alternative\nrate. At December 31, 2022, our loan portfolio had a carrying value of $2.0 billion of floating rate loans, 68.3% or $1.4 billion of which\nhave interest rates tied to LIBOR and 31.7% or $646.2 million of which have interest rates tied to SOFR.\n7",

We predominantly originate floating-rate first mortgage loans, or whole loans, directly to\nborrowers. The direct origination of whole loans enables us to better control the structure of the loans and to maintain direct lending\nrelationships with borrowers. Additionally, we may acquire whole loans from third parties that conform to our investment strategy. We\nmay create tranches of a loan we originate, consisting of an A-note (described below) and a B-note (described below), as well as\nmezzanine loans or other participations, which we may hold or sell to third parties. We do not obtain ratings on these investments. With\nrespect to our portfolio at December 31, 2022, our whole loan investments had loan-to-collateral value, or LTV, ratios that typically do\nnot exceed 85%. Typically, our whole loans are structured with an original term of up to three years, with one-year extensions that bring\nthe loan to a maximum term of five years.

    "text": "Subordinate interests in whole loans (B-notes). To a lesser extent, we may invest in subordinate interests in whole loans,\nreferred to as B-notes, which we will either directly originate or purchase from third parties. B-notes are loans secured by a first mortgage\nbut are subordinated to an A-note. The subordination of a B-note is generally evidenced by an intercreditor or participation agreement\nbetween the holders of the A-note and the B-note. In some instances, the B-note lender may require a security interest in the stock or\nother equity interests of the borrower as part of the transaction. B-note lenders have the same obligations, collateral and borrower as the\nA-note lender, but typically are subordinated in recovery upon a default to the A-note lender. B-notes share certain credit characteristics\nwith second mortgages in that both are subject to greater credit risk with respect to the underlying mortgage collateral than the\ncorresponding first mortgage or A-note. We do not intend to obtain ratings on these investments. We expect our typical B-note\ninvestments to have LTV ratios between 55% and 80% and will generally be structured with an original term of up to three years, with\none-year extensions that bring the loan to a maximum term of five years. We expect to hold any B-note investments to maturity. We did\nnot hold any B-note investments at December 31, 2022.\nIn addition to the accrued interest receivable on a B-note, we may earn fees charged to the borrower under the note or additional\nincome by receiving principal payments in excess of the discounted price (below par value) we paid to acquire the note. Our ownership\nof a B-note with controlling class rights may, in the event the financing fails to perform according to its terms, cause us to pursue our\nremedies as owner of the B-note, which may include foreclosure on, or modification of, the note. In some cases, the owner of the A-\nnote may be able to foreclose or modify the note against our wishes as owner of the B-note. As a result, our economic and business\ninterests may diverge from the interests of the owner of the A-note.\nMezzanine financing. Historically, we have invested in mezzanine loans that are senior to the borrower\u2019s equity in, and\nsubordinate to the mortgage loan on, a property. A mezzanine loan is typically secured by a pledge of the ownership interests in the\nentity that directly owns the real property or by a second lien mortgage loan on the property. In addition, mezzanine loans typically\ninclude credit enhancements such as letters of credit, personal guarantees of the principals of the borrower, or collateral unrelated to the\nproperty. A mezzanine loan may be structured so that we receive a stated fixed or variable interest rate on the loan as well as a percentage\nof gross revenues and a percentage of the increase in the fair market value of the property securing the loan, payable upon maturity,\nrefinancing or sale of the property. Mezzanine loans may also have prepayment lockouts, penalties, minimum profit hurdles and other\nmechanisms to protect and enhance returns in the event of premature repayment.

    "text": "Regulatory Aspects of Our Investment Strategy:\nExclusion from Regulation Under the Investment Company Act\nWe operate our business so as to be excluded from regulation under the Investment Company Act. Because we conduct our\nbusiness through wholly-owned subsidiaries, we must ensure not only that we qualify for an exclusion from regulation under the\nInvestment Company Act, but also that each of our subsidiaries also qualifies.\nWe believe that ACRES Realty Funding, Inc., (\u201cACRES RF\u201d) the subsidiary that at December 31, 2022 held substantially all\nof our CRE loan assets, is excluded from Investment Company Act regulation under Section 3(c)(5)(C), a provision designed for\ncompanies that do not issue redeemable securities and are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring\nmortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate. To qualify for this exclusion, at least 55% of ACRES RF\u2019s assets must consist\nof mortgage loans and other assets that are considered the functional equivalent of mortgage loans for purposes of the Investment\nCompany Act and interests in real properties, which we refer to as Qualifying Interests. Moreover, 80% of ACRES RF\u2019s assets must\nconsist of Qualifying Interests and other real estate-related assets. ACRES RF has not issued, and does not intend to issue, redeemable\nsecurities.\nWe treat our investments in CRE whole loans, A-notes, specific types of B-notes and specific types of mezzanine loans as\nQualifying Interests for purposes of determining our eligibility for the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) to the extent such\ntreatment is consistent with guidance provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, or its staff. We believe that SEC\nstaff guidance allows us to treat B-notes as Qualifying Interests where we have unilateral rights to instruct the servicer to foreclose upon\na defaulted mortgage loan, replace the servicer in the event the servicer, in its discretion, elects not to foreclose on such a loan, and\npurchase the A-note in the event of a default on the mortgage loan. We believe, based upon an analysis of existing SEC staff guidance,\nthat we may treat mezzanine loans as Qualifying Interests where (i) the borrower is a special purpose bankruptcy-remote entity whose\nsole purpose is to hold all of the ownership interests in another special purpose entity that owns commercial real property, (ii) both\nentities are organized as limited liability companies or limited partnerships, (iii) under their organizational documents and the loan\ndocuments, neither entity may engage in any other business, (iv) the ownership interests of either entity have no value apart from the\nunderlying real property which is essentially the only asset held by the property-owning entity, (v) the value of the underlying property\nin excess of the amount of senior obligations is in excess of the amount of the mezzanine loan, (vi) the borrower pledges its entire\ninterest in the property-owning entity to the lender which obtains a perfected security interest in the collateral and (vii) the relative rights\nand priorities between the mezzanine lender and the senior lenders with respect to claims on the underlying property are set forth in an\nintercreditor agreement between the parties which gives the mezzanine lender certain cure and purchase rights in case there is a default\non the senior loan.

If the SEC staff provides future guidance that these investments are not Qualifying Interests, then we will treat them,\nfor purposes of determining our eligibility for the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C), as real estate-related assets or miscellaneous\nassets, as appropriate. Historically, we have held \u201cwhole pool certificates\u201d in mortgage loans, although, at December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nwe had no whole pool certificates in our portfolios. Pursuant to existing SEC staff guidance, we consider whole pool certificates to be\nQualifying Interests. A whole pool certificate is a certificate that represents the entire beneficial interest in an underlying pool of\nmortgage loans. By contrast, a certificate that represents less than the entire beneficial interest in the underlying mortgage loans is not\nconsidered to be a Qualifying Interest for purposes of the 55% test, but constitutes a real estate-related asset for purposes of the 80%\ntest.\nTo the extent ACRES RF holds its CRE loan assets through wholly or majority-owned CRE debt securitization vehicles or\nspecial purpose entities, or SPEs, ACRES RF also intends to conduct its operations so that it will not come within the definition of an\ninvestment company set forth in Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act because less than 40% of the value of its total assets\n(exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis will consist of \u201cinvestment securities,\u201d which we refer\nto as the 40% test. \u201cInvestment securities\u201d exclude U.S. government securities and securities of majority-owned subsidiaries that are not\nthemselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company under Section 3(c)(1)\nor Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. Certain of the wholly-owned CRE debt securitization subsidiaries of ACRES RF\nrely on Section 3(c)(5)(C) for their Investment Company Act exemption, with the result that ACRES RF\u2019s interests in the CRE debt\nsecuritization subsidiaries do not constitute \u201cinvestment securities\u201d for the purpose of the 40% test.\nOur other subsidiaries, RCC Commercial, Inc., or RCC Commercial, RCC Commercial II, Inc., or Commercial II, RCC\nCommercial III, Inc., or Commercial III, RCC TRS, LLC, or RCC TRS, Resource TRS, LLC, or Resource TRS, and RSO EquityCo,\nLLC, or RSO Equity, do not qualify for the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion.

In addition, with respect to those subsidiaries for which we rely upon the Section 3(c)(1) exclusion, and as\nrequired thereby, we limit the number of holders of their securities to not more than 100 persons calculated in accordance with the\nattribution rules of Section 3(c)(1), and with respect to those subsidiaries for which we rely on the Section 3(c)(7) exclusion, and as\nrequired thereby, we limit ownership of their securities to \u201cqualified purchasers.\u201d If we form other subsidiaries, we must ensure that\nthey qualify for an exemption or exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act.\n14",

Moreover, assets acquired by us pursuant to our repurchase\nagreements, warehouse facilities, senior secured financing facility or other short-term financings may not be suitable for refinancing\nthrough long-term arrangements that may require us to liquidate some or all of the related assets.\n\uf0b7 We will incur losses on our repurchase transactions if the counterparty to the transactions defaults on its obligation to resell the\nunderlying assets back to us at the end of the transaction term, or if the value of the underlying assets has declined as of the end of\nthe term or if we default in our obligations to purchase the assets.\n\uf0b7 We may have to repurchase assets that we have sold in connection with CRE debt securitizations and other securitizations.\n\uf0b7 Financing our REIT qualifying assets with repurchase agreements and warehouse facilities could adversely affect our ability to\nqualify as a REIT.\n\uf0b7 Historically, we have financed most of our investments through CRE debt securitizations and have retained the equity.

    "text": "Risks Related to Impact of Current Economic Conditions\nIf current economic and market conditions were to deteriorate, our ability to obtain the capital and financing necessary for growth\nmay be limited, which could limit our profitability, ability to make distributions and the market price of our common stock.\nWe depend upon the availability of adequate debt and equity capital for growth in our operations. Although historically we\nhave been able to raise both debt and equity capital, recent market and economic conditions have made obtaining additional equity\ncapital highly dilutive to existing shareholders and may possibly affect our ability to raise debt capital. If current economic conditions\nwere to deteriorate, our ability to access debt or equity capital on acceptable terms, could be further limited, which could limit our ability\nto generate growth, our profitability, our ability to make distributions and the market price of our common stock. In addition, as a REIT,\nwe must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid\nand excluding net capital gain, to our stockholders and are therefore not able to retain significant amounts of our earnings for new\ninvestments, except where the existence of NOL and net capital loss carryforwards enable us to do so. While we may, through our TRSs\nretain earnings as new capital, we are subject to REIT qualification requirements that limit the value of TRS stock and securities relative\nto the other assets owned by a REIT.\nThe outbreak of widespread contagious disease, such as COVID-19, has caused, and may continue to cause, disruptions to the U.S.\nand global economy and to our business, which has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial condition,\nour results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources.\nIn December 2019, COVID-19 was identified and the resulting global proliferation of the virus led the World Health\nOrganization to designate COVID-19 as a pandemic and numerous countries, including the U.S., to declare national emergencies. Many\ncountries have responded to the outbreak by instituting quarantines and restrictions on travel, which has resulted in the closure or remote\noperation of non-essential businesses. While the U.S. and certain countries around the world have eased restrictions and financial markets\nand unemployment rates have stabilized to some degree, the pandemic continues to cause uncertainty on the U.S. and global economies,\ngenerally, and the CRE business in particular.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on our financial condition, liquidity\nand results of operations and the market price of our common stock and preferred stock. We expect that these impacts are likely to\ncontinue to some extent as the longer-term macro-economic effects of the pandemic continue. Although many or all facets of our\nbusiness have been or could be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we currently believe the following impacts to be among the most\nmaterial to us:\n\u2022 COVID-19 could have a significant long-term impact on the broader economy and the CRE market generally, which would\nnegatively impact the value of the properties collateralizing our loans. Our portfolio includes loans collateralized by hotel,\nretail, office, multifamily and other property types that are particularly negatively impacted by the pandemic.

When utilized,\nif we do not have the funds available to make required payments, it would likely result in defaults under the particular\nfacilities affected that, because of cross-default provisions, could result in defaults under other debt instruments as well as\npotential loss of our assets to the lenders unless we are able to raise the funds from alternative sources, including by selling\nor financing assets or raising capital, each of which we may be required to do under adverse market conditions or at an\ninopportune time or on unfavorable terms, or may be unable to do at all. The COVID-19 pandemic has made it very\ndifficult for businesses generally, including us, to access liquidity sources at terms commensurate with those prior to this\npandemic, or at all. Pledging additional collateral or otherwise paying down facilities to satisfy our lenders and avoid\npotential margin calls and loan defaults would reduce our cash available to meet subsequent margin calls and/or future\nfunding requests as well as make other, higher yielding investments, thereby decreasing our liquidity, return on equity,\navailable cash, net income and ability to implement our investment strategy. If we cannot meet lender requirements related\nto margin calls or other terms of our credit agreements, the lender or counterparty could accelerate our indebtedness,\nincrease the interest rate on advanced funds and terminate our ability to borrow additional funds, which would materially\nand adversely affect our financial condition and ability to implement our investment strategy.\n\u2022 The COVID-19 pandemic has in the past reduced, and may reduce, the availability of liquidity sources, but our\nrequirements for liquidity, including future funding commitments and potential margin calls, likely will not be\ncommensurately reduced. If we do not have funds available to meet our obligations, we would have to raise funds from\nalternative sources, which may be at unfavorable terms or may not be available to us due to the impacts of COVID-19. We\nexpect that the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our liquidity position and could limit our\nability to grow our business and fully execute our business strategy. We seek to preserve and build our liquidity to best\nposition us to weather near-term market uncertainty, satisfy our loan future funding requests and to potentially make new\ninvestments, which will cause us to take some or all of the following actions: borrow additional capital, sell assets and /or\nchange our dividend distributions consistent with REIT distribution requirements.\n\u2022 Interest rates and credit spreads have been significantly impacted since the outbreak of COVID-19. This can result in\nvolatile changes to the fair value of our floating rate loans, fixed-rate loans and CRE securities and also the interest\nobligations on our floating-rate borrowings, which could result in an increase to our interest expense.\nWe also have experienced and may continue to experience other negative impacts to our business as a result of the pandemic\nthat could exacerbate other risks, including:\n\u2022 lack of liquidity in our assets;\n\u2022 greater risk of loss on our mezzanine loans;\n\u2022 risk associated with loans that are in transition;\n\u2022 the concentration of our loans and investments in certain geographies, property types or relationships in areas",

    "text": "The rapid development of the pandemic and the resulting economic effects have created uncertainty surrounding the ultimate\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy generally, and the CRE business in particular. As a result, we cannot project\nthe ultimate adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy or our business, including our financial condition and\nperformance. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 will depend on future developments, including new information that may emerge\nabout the severity of the pandemic, the timing, scope and effectiveness of additional governmental responses to the pandemic, including\nthe potential re-imposition of quarantines, states of emergencies, restrictions on travel and stay-at-home orders and the ensuing reactions\nby consumers, companies, governmental entities and global markets.\nA prolonged economic slowdown or lengthy or severe recession causing declining real estate values could impair our investments\nand harm our operations.\nWe believe the risks associated with our business will be more severe during periods of economic slowdown or recession if\nthese periods are accompanied by declining real estate values. Declining real estate values will likely reduce the level of new mortgage\nloan originations and other real estate-related investment activities since borrowers often use the appreciation in their existing real estate\nholdings or the expected appreciation in value-add projects to support the purchase of or incremental investment in additional properties.\nFurther, declining real estate values significantly increase the likelihood that we will incur losses on our loans in the event of default\nbecause the value of our collateral may be insufficient to cover our investment in the loan. Any sustained period of increased payment\ndelinquencies, foreclosures or losses could adversely affect our ability to invest in, sell or securitize loans, which could materially and\nadversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and our ability to pay distributions.\nRisks Related to Our Financing\nOur portfolio has been financed in material part through the use of leverage that may reduce the return on our investments and cash\navailable for distribution.\nOur portfolio has been financed in material part through the use of leverage and, as credit market conditions permit, we will\nseek such financing in the future. Using leverage subjects us to risks associated with debt financing, including the risks that:\n\u2022 the cash provided by our operating activities will not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest,\n\u2022 the cost of financing may increase relative to the income from the assets financed, reducing the income we have available\nto pay distributions, and\n\u2022 our investments may have maturities that differ from the maturities of the related financing and, consequently, the risk that\nthe terms of any refinancing we obtain will not be as favorable as the terms of existing financing.\nIf we are unable to secure refinancing of our currently outstanding financing, when due, on acceptable terms, we may be forced\nto dispose of some of our assets at disadvantageous terms or to obtain financing at unfavorable terms, either of which may result in\nlosses to us or reduce the cash flow available to meet our debt service obligations or to pay distributions.\nFinancing that we may obtain and financing we have obtained through CRE debt securitizations typically require, or will\nrequire, us to maintain a specified ratio of the amount of the financing to the value of the assets financed.

Lenders typically have the right to liquidate assets securing or acquired under these\nfacilities upon the occurrence of specified events, such as an event of default. We are exposed to loss if the proceeds received by the\nlender upon liquidation are insufficient to satisfy our obligation to the lender. We are also subject to the risk that the assets subject to\nsuch repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities or other debt might not be suitable for long-term refinancing or securitization\ntransactions. If we are unable to refinance these assets on a long-term basis, or if long-term financing is more expensive than we\nanticipated at the time of our acquisition of the assets to be financed, we might be required to liquidate assets.\nWe will incur losses on our repurchase transactions if the counterparty to the transactions defaults on its obligation to resell the\nunderlying assets back to us at the end of the transaction term, or if the value of the underlying assets has declined as of the end of\nthe term or if we default in our obligations to purchase the assets.\nWhen engaged in repurchase transactions, we generally sell assets to the transaction counterparty and receive cash from the\ncounterparty. The counterparty must resell the assets back to us at the end of the term of the transaction. Because the cash we receive\nfrom the counterparty when we initially sell the assets is less than the market value of those assets, if the counterparty defaults on its\nobligation to resell the assets back to us we will incur a loss on the transaction. We will also incur a loss if the value of the underlying\nassets has declined as of the end of the transaction term, as we will have to repurchase the assets for their initial value but would receive\nassets worth less than that amount.

We believe that we will be\ntreated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the owner of the assets that are the subject of any such agreement, notwithstanding that\nwe may transfer record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the agreement. It is possible, however, that the\nInternal Revenue Service, or IRS, could assert that we did not own the assets during the term of the sale and repurchase agreement, in\nwhich case our ability to qualify as a REIT would be adversely affected.

Posting additional collateral to support these facilities would reduce our liquidity\nand limit our ability to leverage our assets. In the event we do not have sufficient liquidity to meet such requirements, lenders can\naccelerate the indebtedness, increase interest rates and terminate our ability to borrow. Further, lenders may require us to maintain a\ncertain amount of uninvested cash or set aside unlevered assets sufficient to maintain a specified liquidity position. As a result, we may\nnot be able to leverage our assets as fully as we would choose, which could reduce our return on assets. In the event that we are unable\nto meet these collateral obligations, our financial condition could deteriorate rapidly.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe may change our investment strategy without stockholder consent, which may result in riskier investments than those currently\ntargeted.\nSubject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and our exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act, we\nmay change our investment strategy, including the percentage of assets that may be invested in each asset class, or in the case of\nsecurities, in a single issuer, at any time without the consent of our stockholders, which could result in our making investments that are\ndifferent from, and possibly riskier than, the investments described in this report. A change in our investment strategy may increase our\nexposure to interest rate, credit market and real estate market fluctuations, all of which may reduce the market price of our common\nstock and reduce our ability to make distributions to stockholders. Furthermore, a change in our asset allocation could result in our\nmaking investments in asset categories different from those described in this report.\nWe believe earnings available for distribution (\"EAD\"), a non-GAAP financial measure, is an appropriate measure to evaluate our\nperformance and ability to pay dividends; however, in certain instances EAD may not be reflective of actual economic results.\nWe utilize EAD as a measure to evaluate our performance and ability to pay dividends and believe that it is useful to analysts,\ninvestors and other parties in the evaluations of REITs. We believe EAD is a useful measure of our performance and ability to pay\ndividends because it excludes the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that we believe are not necessarily indicative of\nour current CRE loan origination portfolio and other CRE-related investments and operations.

If the market value of those assets declines, the lender may require us to post additional collateral to\nsupport the loan. If we are unable to post the additional collateral, we would have to repay some portion or all of the loan, which may\nrequire us to sell assets, which could potentially be under adverse market conditions. As a result, our earnings would be reduced or we\ncould sustain losses, and cash available to make distributions could be reduced or eliminated.\nIncreases in interest rates and other factors could reduce the value of our investments, result in reduced earnings or losses and\nreduce our ability to pay distributions.\nA significant risk associated with our investment in CRE-related loans, and, historically, our CMBS and other debt investments\nis the risk that either or both of long-term and short-term interest rates increase significantly. If long-term rates increase, the market\nvalue of our assets would decline. Even if assets underlying investments we may own in the future are guaranteed by one or more\npersons, including government or government-sponsored agencies, those guarantees do not protect against declines in market value of\nthe related assets caused by interest rate changes. At the same time, with respect to assets that are not match-funded or that have been\nacquired with variable rate or short-term financing, an increase in short-term interest rates would increase our interest expense, reducing\nour net interest spread or possibly result in negative cash flow from those assets. This could result in reduced profitability and\ndistributions or losses.\nChanges in the method for determining the benchmark rate (LIBOR or a replacement of LIBOR) may adversely affect the value of\nour loans, investments and borrowings and could affect our results of operations.\nHistorically, we have utilized LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate for the pricing of our CRE loans and have been exposed to\nLIBOR through our issuance of notes on our securitizations and the use of term facilities and repurchase agreements. In July 2017, the\nU.K. FCA announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. In March 2021, the FCA announced that it\nwould cease publication of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR immediately after December 31, 2021 and cease publication of\nthe remaining tenors immediately after June 30, 2023. Additionally, the U.S. Federal Reserve encouraged companies to cease using\nLIBOR as a benchmark rate by December 31, 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates\nCommittee, a steering committee comprising large U.S. financial institutions, has identified SOFR, a new index calculated by short-\nterm repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities, as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR.\nIn connection with such recommendations and developments, all variable rate loans originated by us beginning January 1, 2022\nhave been benchmarked to SOFR. All of our floating-rate loans contain terms that allow for the transition to alternative rates. In\nSeptember 2021 and January 2022, the term warehouse financing facilities with JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, respectively,\nwere amended to allow for the transition to alternative rates, including rates tied to SOFR, subject to benchmark transition events",

When\nLIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to amend our remaining loan and borrowing agreements that utilize LIBOR as a factor in\ndetermining the interest rate or hedge against fluctuations in LIBOR based on a new standard that is established, if any. Any resulting\ndifferences in interest rate standards among our assets and our borrowings may result in interest rate mismatches between our assets and\nthe borrowings used to fund such assets. The transition from LIBOR to SOFR or to another alternative rate may result in financial market\ndisruptions and significant increases in benchmark rates, resulting in increased financing costs to us, any of which could have an adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock.\nInvesting in mezzanine debt, preferred equity, mezzanine or other subordinated tranches of CMBS involves greater risks of loss than\nsenior secured debt investments.\nSubject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act, we may\ninvest in mezzanine debt, preferred equity and mezzanine or other subordinated tranches of CMBS. We currently have investments in\nmezzanine debt. These types of investments carry a higher degree of risk of loss than senior secured debt investments such as our whole\nloan investments because, in the event of default and foreclosure, holders of senior liens will be paid in full before mezzanine investors.\nDepending on the value of the underlying collateral at the time of foreclosure, there may not be sufficient assets to pay all or any part of\namounts owed to mezzanine investors. Moreover, mezzanine and other subordinate debt investments may have higher LTV than\nconventional senior lien financing, resulting in less equity in the collateral and increasing the risk of loss of principal.

Preferred equity investments involve\na higher degree of risk than first mortgage loans due to a variety of factors, including the risk that, similar to mezzanine loans, such\ninvestments are subordinate to first mortgage loans and are not collateralized by property underlying the investment. Unlike mezzanine\nloans, preferred equity investments generally do not have a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the\nentity owning the property. Although as a holder of preferred equity we may enhance our position with covenants that limit the activities\nof the entity in which we hold an interest and protect our equity by obtaining an exclusive right to control the underlying property after\nan event of default, should such a default occur on our investment, we would only be able to proceed against the entity in which we hold\nan interest, and not the property owned by such entity and underlying our investment. As a result, we may not recover some or all of our\ninvestment.\nWe record some of our portfolio investments, including those classified as assets held for sale, at fair value as estimated by our\nmanagement and, as a result, there will be uncertainty as to the value of these investments.\nWe currently hold, and expect that we will hold in the future, portfolio investments that are not publicly traded.

The value of our common stock will likely decrease if our determinations\nregarding the fair value of these investments are materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon their disposal.\nWe may face competition for suitable investments.\nThere are numerous REITs and other financial investors seeking to invest in the types of assets we target.

The ability of a borrower to repay a loan or make distributions secured by or\ndependent upon an income-producing property typically depends primarily upon the successful operation of the property rather than\nupon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower. If the net operating income of the property is reduced, the borrower\u2019s\nability to repay the loan or ability to make distributions may be impaired. Net operating income of an income producing property can\nbe affected by, among other things:\n\u2022 tenant mix, success of tenant businesses, tenant bankruptcies and property management decisions;\n\u2022 property location and condition;\n\u2022 competition from comparable types of properties;\n\u2022 shifts in consumer habits or adoption of telework policies;\n\u2022 changes in laws that increase operating expenses or limit rents that may be charged;\n\u2022 any need to address environmental contamination at the property;\n\u2022 the occurrence of any uninsured casualty at the property;\n\u2022 changes in national, regional or local economic conditions and/or the conditions of specific industry segments in which\nthe lessees may operate;\n\u2022 declines in regional or local real estate values;\n\u2022 declines in regional or local rental or occupancy rates;\n\u2022 increases in interest rates, real estate tax rates and other operating expenses;\n\u2022 the availability of debt or equity financing;\n\u2022 increases in costs of construction material;\n\u2022 changes in governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies, including environmental legislation and zoning laws; and\n\u2022 acts of God, terrorism, pandemic, social unrest and civil disturbances.\nWe risk loss of principal on defaulted CRE loans we hold to the extent of any deficiency between the value we can realize from\nthe sale of the collateral securing the loan upon foreclosure and the loan\u2019s principal and accrued interest. Moreover, foreclosure of a\nmortgage loan can be an expensive and lengthy process that could reduce the net amount we can realize on the foreclosed mortgage\nloan. In a bankruptcy of a mortgage loan borrower, the mortgage loan will be deemed to be secured only to the extent of the value of\nthe underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy as determined by the bankruptcy court, and the lien securing the mortgage loan will\nbe subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in-possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state\nlaw.\nWe may be obligated to fund a portion of the loan at one or more future dates.

We base our allowance for credit losses on historical loss experience, current portfolio and market\nconditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts for the duration of each respective loan. However, losses have in the past, and may\nin the future, exceed our current estimates, and the difference could be substantial. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes\nin economic, operating and other conditions that may be beyond our control and difficult to estimate, including changes in interest rates,\nchanges in borrowers\u2019 creditworthiness and the value of collateral securing loans. Additionally, if we seek to expand our loan portfolios,\nwe may need to make additional provisions for credit losses to ensure that the allowance remains at levels deemed appropriate by our\nmanagement for the size and quality of our portfolios. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2022 is\nadequate to cover our anticipated losses, we cannot assure you that it will not increase in the future. Any increase in our allowance for\ncredit losses will reduce our income and, if sufficiently large, could cause us to incur significant losses.\nThe CECL model may require us to increase our allowance for credit losses and therefore may have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe CECL allowance required is a valuation account that is deducted from the related loans\u2019 and debt securities\u2019 amortized\ncost basis on our consolidated balance sheets, which reduces our total stockholders\u2019 equity. Additional changes to the CECL allowance\nare recognized through net income on our consolidated statements of operations. While the guidance does not require any particular\nmethod for determining the CECL allowance, it does specify the allowance should be based on relevant information about past events,\nincluding historical loss experience, current portfolio and market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts for the duration\nof each respective loan. Because our methodology for determining CECL allowances may differ from the methodologies employed by\nother companies, our CECL allowances may not be comparable with the CECL allowances reported by other companies. In addition,\nother than pursuant to a few narrow exceptions, the guidance requires that all financial instruments subject to the CECL model have\nsome amount of reserve to reflect the GAAP principal underlying the CECL model that all loans, debt securities, and similar assets have\nsome inherent risk of loss, regardless of credit quality, subordinate capital, or other mitigating factors.

If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for credit losses for any\nreason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur investment portfolio may have material geographic, sector, property-type and sponsor concentrations.\nWe may have material geographic concentrations related to our direct or indirect investments in real estate loans and properties.\nWe also may have material concentrations in the property types and industry sectors that are in our loan portfolio. Where we have any\nkind of concentration risk in our investments, we may be affected by sector-specific economic or other problems that are not reflected\nin the national economy generally or in more diverse portfolios. Where we have a significant concentration of investments with a small\nnumber of sponsors, we may be materially affected by an individual sponsors\u2019 performance. An adverse development in that area of\nconcentration could reduce the value of our investment and our return on that investment and, if the concentration affects a material\namount of our investments, impair our ability to execute our investment strategies successfully, reduce our earnings and reduce our\nability to make distributions.\nThe B-notes in which we may invest may be subject to additional risks relating to the privately negotiated structure and terms of the\ntransaction, which may result in losses to us.\nWe may invest in B-notes. A B-note is a loan typically secured by a first mortgage on a single large commercial property or\ngroup of related properties and subordinated to a senior note secured by the same first mortgage on the same collateral. As a result, if a\nborrower defaults, there may not be sufficient funds remaining for B-note owners after payment to the senior note owners. Since each\ntransaction is privately negotiated, B-notes can vary in their structural characteristics and risks. For example, the rights of holders of B-\nnotes to control the process following a borrower default may be limited in certain investments. Depending upon market and economic\nconditions, we may make B-note investments at any time. B-notes are less liquid than other forms of CRE debt investments, such as\nCMBS, and, as a result, we may be able to dispose of underperforming or non-performing B-note investments only at a significant\ndiscount to book value.\n28",

We have not established a minimum distribution payment level, and our\nability to make distributions may be impaired by the risk factors described in this report. All distributions will be made at the discretion\nof our Board and will depend on our earnings, our financial condition, maintenance of our REIT qualification and other factors as our\nBoard may deem relevant from time to time. We may not be able to make distributions in the future. In addition, some of our distributions\nmay include a return of capital. To the extent that we decide to make distributions in excess of our current and accumulated taxable\nearnings and profits, such distributions would generally be considered a return of capital for federal income tax purposes. A return of\ncapital is not taxable, but it has the effect of reducing the holder\u2019s tax basis in its investment. Although we currently do not expect that\nwe will do so, we have in the past and may in the future also use proceeds from any offering of our securities that we have not invested\nor borrowed funds to make distributions. If we use uninvested offering proceeds to pay distributions in the future, we will have less\nfunds available for investment and, as a result, our earnings and cash available for distribution would be less than we might otherwise\nhave realized had such funds been invested. Similarly, if we borrow to fund distributions, our future interest costs would increase,\nthereby reducing our future earnings and cash available for distribution from what they otherwise would have been.\nLoss of our exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act would require significant changes in our operations and\ncould reduce the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions.\nWe rely on an exclusion from registration as an investment company afforded by Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company\nAct. To qualify for this exclusion, we do not engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading securities and\nwe do not own \u201cinvestment securities\u201d with a value that exceeds 40% of the value of our total assets (exclusive of government securities\nand cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.

    "text": " these rules are subject to change and\nsuch changes may have an adverse impact on us. We may need to avail ourselves of alternative exclusions and exemptions that may\nrequire a change in the organizational structure of our business.\nFurthermore, as it relates to our investment in our real estate subsidiary, ACRES RF, we rely on an exclusion from registration\nas an investment company afforded by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. Given the material size of ACRES RF\nrelative to our 3(a)(1)(C) exclusion, were ACRES RF to be deemed to be an investment company (other than by application of the\nSection 3(c)(1) exemption for closely held companies and the Section 3(c)(7) exemption for companies owned by \u201cqualified\npurchasers\u201d), we would not qualify for our 3(a)(1)(C) exclusion. Under the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion, ACRES RF is required to\nmaintain, on the basis of positions taken by the SEC staff in interpretive and no-action letters, a minimum of 55% of the value of the\ntotal assets of its portfolio in Qualifying Interests and a minimum of 80% in Qualifying Interests and real estate-related assets, with the\nremainder permitted to be miscellaneous assets. Because registration as an investment company would significantly affect ACRES RF\u2019s\nability to engage in certain transactions or to organize itself in the manner it is currently organized, we intend to maintain its qualification\nfor this exclusion from registration.\nHistorically, we treat our investments in mezzanine loans and our investments in CMBS as Qualifying Interests for purposes\nof determining our eligibility for the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) to the extent such treatment is consistent with guidance\nprovided by the SEC or its staff. In the absence of specific guidance or guidance that otherwise supports the treatment of these\ninvestments as Qualifying Interests, we will treat them, for purposes of determining our eligibility for the exclusion provided by Section\n3(c)(5)(C), as real estate-related assets or miscellaneous assets, as appropriate.\nIf ACRES RF\u2019s portfolio does not comply with the requirements of the exclusion we rely upon, it could be forced to alter its\nportfolio by selling or otherwise disposing of a substantial portion of the assets that are not Qualifying Interests or by acquiring a\nsignificant position in assets that are Qualifying Interests. Altering its portfolio in this manner may have an adverse effect on its\ninvestments if it is forced to dispose of or acquire assets in an unfavorable market, and may adversely affect our stock price.\nIf it were established that we were an unregistered investment company, there would be a risk that we would be subject to\nmonetary penalties and injunctive relief in an action brought by the SEC that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties,\nthat third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions undertaken during the period it was established that we were an\nunregistered investment company, and that we would be subject to limitations on corporate leverage that would have an adverse impact\non our investment returns.\n34",

If the decline in real estate asset values and/or income occurs quickly, this may be especially difficult to accomplish. We\nmay have to make investment decisions that we otherwise would not make absent REIT qualification and Investment Company Act\nconsiderations.\nRisks Related to Our REIT Status and Certain Other Tax Items\nComplying with REIT requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities.\nTo qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy various tests regarding the sources of our\nincome, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our common\nstock. In order to meet these tests, we may be required to forgo investments we might otherwise make. Thus, compliance with the REIT\nrequirements may hinder our investment performance.\nIn particular, at least 75% of our assets at the end of each calendar quarter must consist of real estate assets, government\nsecurities, cash and cash items. For this purpose, \u201creal estate assets\u201d generally include interests in real property, such as land, buildings,\nleasehold interests in real property, stock of other entities that qualify as REITs, interests in mortgage loans secured by real property,\ninvestments in stock or debt investments during the one-year period following the receipt of new capital and regular or residual interests\nin a real estate mortgage investment conduit (\u201cREMIC\u201d). In addition, the amount of securities of a single issuer, other than a TRS, that\nwe hold must generally not exceed either 5% of the value of our gross assets or 10% of the vote or value of such issuer\u2019s outstanding\nsecurities.\nCertain of the assets that we hold are not qualified and will not be qualified real estate assets for purposes of the REIT asset\ntests. CMBS securities should generally qualify as real estate assets. However, to the extent that we own non-REMIC collateralized\nmortgage obligations or other debt investments secured by mortgage loans (rather than by real property) or secured by non-real estate\nassets, or debt securities that are not secured by mortgages on real property, those securities are likely not qualifying real estate assets\nfor purposes of the REIT asset test, and will not produce qualifying real estate income. Further, whether securities held by warehouse\nlenders or financed using repurchase agreements are treated as qualifying assets or as generating qualifying real estate income for\npurposes of the REIT asset and income tests depends on the terms of the warehouse or repurchase financing arrangement.\nWe generally will be treated as the owner of any assets that collateralize CRE debt securitization transactions to the extent that\nwe retain all of the equity of the securitization vehicle and do not make an election to treat such securitization vehicle as a TRS, as\ndescribed in further detail below.

Excess inclusion income also is generated if we issue debt obligations, such as certain CRE debt securitizations, with\ntwo or more maturities and the terms of the payments on these obligations bore a relationship to the payments that we received on our\nmortgage related securities securing those debt obligations. While we do not expect to acquire significant amounts of residual interests\nin REMICs, nor do we currently own residual interests in taxable mortgage pools, we do issue debt in certain CRE debt securitizations\nthat generates excess inclusion income.\n35",

If the stockholder is a foreign person, it would be subject to federal income tax withholding on this\nincome without reduction or exemption pursuant to any otherwise applicable income tax treaty.\nIf we realize excess inclusion income, we will be taxed at the highest corporate income tax rate on a portion of such income\nthat is allocable to the percentage of our stock held in record name by \u201cdisqualified organizations,\u201d which are generally cooperatives,\ngovernmental entities and tax-exempt organizations that are exempt from unrelated business taxable income.

Unless we qualified for relief under certain cure provisions in the Code, such failures could\ncause us to fail to qualify as a REIT.\nOur subsidiaries and we have invested and may invest in the future in distressed debt, including distressed mortgage loans,\nmezzanine loans, B-notes and MBS. Revenue Procedure 2011-16, as modified and superseded by Revenue Procedure 2014-51, provides\nthat the IRS will treat a distressed mortgage loan acquired by a REIT that is secured by real property and other property as producing in\npart non-qualifying income for the 75% gross income test. Specifically, Revenue Procedure 2011-16, as modified and superseded by\nRevenue Procedure 2014-51, indicates that interest income on a loan will be treated as qualifying income based on the ratio of (1) the\nfair market value of the real property securing the loan determined as of the date the REIT committed to acquire the loan and (2) the\nface amount of the loan (and not the purchase price or current value of the loan). The face amount of a distressed mortgage loan and\nother distressed debt will typically exceed the fair market value of the real property securing the debt on the date the REIT commits to\nacquire the debt. We believe that we will continue to invest in distressed debt in a manner consistent with complying with the 75% gross\nincome test and maintaining our qualification as a REIT.\nThe failure of a loan subject to a repurchase agreement, a mezzanine loan or a preferred equity investment to qualify as a real estate\nasset would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.\nWe have entered into and we",

We believe that we\nhave been and will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the owner of the loan assets that are the subject of any such\nagreement notwithstanding that the agreement may transfer record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the\nagreement. It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert that we did not own the loan assets during the term of the sale and repurchase\nagreement, in which case we could fail to qualify as a REIT.\nIn addition, we have acquired in the past and may continue to acquire mezzanine loans, which are loans secured by equity\ninterest in a partnership or limited liability company that directly or indirectly owns real property, and preferred equity investments,\nwhich are senior equity interests in entities that own or acquire real properties. In Revenue Procedure 2003-65, or the Revenue Procedure,\nthe IRS provided a safe harbor pursuant to which a mezzanine loan, if it meets each of the requirements contained in the Revenue\nProcedure, will be treated by the IRS as a real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests, and interest derived from the mezzanine\nloan will be treated as qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the REIT 75% income test. Although the Revenue Procedure provides\na safe harbor on which taxpayers may rely, it does not prescribe rules of substantive tax law. We have acquired and may continue to\nacquire mezzanine loans that may not meet all of the requirements for reliance on this safe harbor. In the event we own a mezzanine\nloan that does not meet the safe harbor, the IRS could challenge the loan\u2019s treatment as a real estate asset for purposes of the REIT asset\nand income tests, and if the challenge were sustained, we could fail to qualify as a REIT.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe cannot predict the effects on us of actions taken by the U.S. government and governmental agencies in response to economic\nconditions in the U.S.\nIn response to economic and market conditions, U.S. and foreign governments and governmental agencies have established or\nproposed a number of programs designed to improve the financial system and credit markets, and to stimulate economic growth.

As a result of losses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 in connection\nwith the economic impact of the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic, we received significant net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d)\ncarryforwards. NOLs are able to offset future taxable income, limiting the requirement for common share distributions. We also\nrecognized net capital loss carryforwards as finalized in our 2020 tax return. During the year ended December 31, 2022, all taxable\nincome was distributed in the form of a preferred share distribution, and therefore, no common share distribution was required. As we\ncontinue to take steps necessary to stabilize our earnings available for distribution (\"EAD\"), our board of directors, (our \"Board\"), will\nestablish a plan for the prudent resumption of the payment of common share distributions. No assurance, however, can be given as to\nthe amounts or timing of future distributions as such distributions are subject to our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements\nand such other factors as our Board deems relevant.\nThe following table summarizes our current and estimated tax loss carryforwards (dollars in millions):\nTax Year\nRecognized REIT (QRS) Tax Loss Carryforwards TRS Tax Loss Carryforwards\nTax Asset Item Operating Capital Operating Capital\nNet Operating Loss\nCarryforwards:\nCumulative as of 2021 2021 Return $ 46.6 $ \u2014 $ 60.1 $ \u2014\nNet Capital Loss Carryforwards:\nCumulative as of 2021 2021 Return \u2014 121.9 \u2014 1.0\nTotal tax asset estimates $ 46.6 $ 121.9 $ 60.1 $ 1.0\nUseful life Unlimited 5 years Various 5 years\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated $1.1 million of taxable income which was offset by our cumulative\nNOL, leaving $46.6 million to carry forward to future years. NOL can generally be carried forward to offset both ordinary taxable\nincome and capital gains in future years. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d) along with revisions made by the Coronavirus Aid,\nRelief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES\u201d) reduced the deduction for NOLs to 80% of taxable income and granted an indefinite\ncarryforward period.\nAdditionally, $15.0 million of net capital gains was reported on our tax return for the year ended December 31, 2021. This\nwas offset with our cumulative total net capital losses, leaving $121.9 million to carry forward to future years.

Management\u2019s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d within that report.\nOverview\nWe are a Maryland corporation and an externally managed REIT that is primarily focused on originating, holding and managing\ncommercial real estate (\u201cCRE\u201d) mortgage loans and other commercial real estate-related debt investments. On July 31, 2020, our\nmanagement contract was acquired from Exantas Capital Manager Inc., a subsidiary of C-III Capital Partners LLC, by ACRES Capital,\nLLC (our \u201cManager\u201d), a subsidiary of ACRES Capital Corp. (collectively, \u201cACRES\u201d), a private commercial real estate lender\nexclusively dedicated to nationwide middle market CRE lending with a focus on multifamily, student housing, hospitality, office and\nindustrial in top United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) markets (the \u201cACRES acquisition\u201d). Our Manager draws upon the management team of ACRES\nand its collective investment experience to provide its services. Our objective is to provide our stockholders with total returns over time,\nincluding quarterly distributions and capital appreciation, while seeking to manage the risks associated with our investment strategies\nas well as to maximize long-term stockholder value by maintaining stability through our available liquidity and diversified CRE loan\nportfolio.\nAn important aspect of the ACRES acquisition was that it delivered operational liquidity in order to mitigate additional potential\nmargin call risk as a result of the market volatility that was created by the COVID-19 pandemic (see below), which allowed us to focus\non asset management within the portfolio in efforts to restart loan originations and underwriting. Our Manager has and expects to\ncontinue to leverage the complementary nature of our lending platforms, its experience and its network of relationships to enhance our\nnew business loan pipeline. Additionally, our Manager continuously monitors for new capital opportunities and executes on agreements\nthat enhance our returns.\nIn December 2019, COVID-19 was identified. The resulting spread of COVID-19 throughout the globe led the World Health\nOrganization to designate COVID-19 as a pandemic and numerous countries, including the U.S, to declare national emergencies. Many\ncountries responded to the initial and ensuing outbreaks of COVID-19 by instituting quarantines and restrictions on travel and limiting\noperations of non-essential offices and retail centers, which resulted in the closure or remote operation of non-essential businesses,\nincreased rates of unemployment and market disruption in connection with the economic uncertainty. The aforementioned quarantines\nand travel restrictions contributed significantly to economic disruptions across the country that directly impacted our borrowers and\ntheir ability to pay and to stay current with their debt obligations in 2020",

The aforementioned quarantines\nand travel restrictions contributed significantly to economic disruptions across the country that directly impacted our borrowers and\ntheir ability to pay and to stay current with their debt obligations in 2020 and 2021, causing significant increases in our provisions for\ncredit losses. During the height of the pandemic, we used a variety of legal and structural options to manage credit risk effectively,\nincluding through forbearance and extension provisions or other agreements.\nDue in large part to the development and distribution of vaccines and other treatments, the U.S. and other countries around the\nworld have eased or removed restrictions entirely, financial markets are more liquid, collateral performance has improved and\nunemployment rates have stabilized to some degree; as such, at December 31, 2022, we have substantially reversed provisions for credit\nlosses related to macroeconomic factors impacted by COVID-19. For additional discussion with respect to the potential impact of\nCOVID-19 on our liquidity and capital resources, see \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nCurrently, domestic and global markets are grappling with managing rising inflation rates, supply chain disruptions and energy\nmarket dislocations. These additional market pressures are manifesting themselves in higher consumer prices and have led domestic and\nglobal monetary policy makers to raise historically low short-term interest rates at rates much faster than originally anticipated by\ndomestic and global financial markets in hopes of containing inflation and staving off or tempering an economic recession. The U.S.\nFederal Reserve has raised the Federal Funds rate by 4.25% in seven rate hikes between March 2022 and December 2022 to combat\ninflation, and more rate hikes are expected in the near future. These increases in the cost of capital and goods are expected to cause\nshort-term dislocations in various investment and financing markets in which we participate as we and other market participants adjust\nto the new financing environment.\nWe continuously monitor the effects of domestic and global events, including but not limited to the current and expected\nimpacts of inflation, labor shortages, supply chain matters and rising interest rates, on our operations and financial position to ensure\nthat we remain responsive and adaptable to the dynamic changes in our operating environment.

In March 2020, due to\nthe market disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we halted loan originations to manage our liquidity. In conjunction with the\ncapital commitments secured through the ACRES acquisition, we resumed originating floating-rate CRE loans in November 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we originated 19 floating-rate CRE whole loans with total commitments of $610.8 million.\nLoan payoffs during the year ended December 31, 2022 were $399.6 million and net unfunded commitments were $21.2 million,\nproducing a net increase to the portfolio of $190.0 million.\nOur CRE loan portfolio, which had a $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion carrying value at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively,\ncomprised:\n\u2022 First mortgage loans, which we refer to as whole loans. These loans are typically secured by first liens on CRE property,\nincluding the following property types: multifamily, office, hotel, self-storage, retail, student housing, manufactured\nhousing, industrial, healthcare and mixed-use. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our whole loans had a carrying value of\n$2.0 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, or 100.0% and 99.8%, respectively, of the CRE loan portfolio.\n\u2022 Mezzanine debt that is senior to borrower\u2019s equity but is subordinated to other third-party debt. These loans are\nsubordinated CRE loans, usually secured by a pledge of the borrower\u2019s equity ownership in the entity that owns the\nproperty or by a second lien mortgage on the property.

    "text": "While the CRE whole loans included in the CRE loan portfolio are substantially composed of floating-rate loans benchmarked\nto market rates including the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), asset\nyields are protected through the use of benchmark floors and minimum interest periods that typically range from 12 to 18 months at the\ntime of a loan\u2019s origination. Our benchmark floors provide asset yield protection when the benchmark interest rate falls below an in-\nplace benchmark floor. Our net investment returns are enhanced by a decline in the cost of our floating-rate liabilities that do not have\nbenchmark floors. Our net investment returns will be negatively impacted by the rising cost of our floating-rate liabilities that do not\nhave floors until the benchmark interest rate is above the benchmark floor, at which point our floating-rate loans and floating-rate\nliabilities will be match funded, effectively locking in our net interest margin until the benchmark floor rate is activated again or the\nfloating-rate loan is paid off or refinanced.\nIn a business environment where benchmark interest rates are increasing significantly, cash flows of the CRE assets underlying\nour loans may not be sufficient to pay debt service on our loans, which could result in non-performance or default. We partially mitigate\nthis risk by generally requiring our borrowers to purchase interest rate cap agreements with non-affiliated, well-capitalized third parties\nand by selectively requiring our borrowers to have and maintain debt service reserves. These interest rate caps generally mature prior to\nthe maturity date of the loan and the borrowers are required to pay to extend them. In most cases the sponsors will need to fund additional\nequity into the properties to cover these costs as the property may not generate sufficient cash flow to pay these costs. At December 31,\n2022, 88.8% of the par value of our CRE loan portfolio had interest rate caps in place with a weighted-average maturity of 1.1 years.\nAt December 31, 2022, our par-value $2.1 billion floating-rate CRE loan portfolio, which includes one whole loan without a\nbenchmark floor, had a weighted average benchmark floor of 0.68%. At December 31, 2021, our par-value $1.9 billion floating rate\nCRE loan portfolio, which includes one whole loan without a benchmark floor, had a weighted average benchmark floor of 0.75%. The\ndecrease in the weighted average benchmark floor was a result of older CRE floating-rate loans with higher floors paying off and being\nreplaced with newer loans with lower floors. With the trend of rising benchmark interest rates in 2022 (both LIBOR and SOFR), we\nhave seen the coupons on all of our floating-rate assets and debt rise accordingly. Because we have equity invested in each floating-rate\nloan, and because in all instances the benchmark interest rates are above our loan floors, the rise in interest rates expected by the market\nwill result in an increase in our net interest income.

In July 2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with\nthe Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprising large U.S. financial institutions, has identified SOFR as\nits preferred alternative rate for LIBOR.\nAll variable rate loans originated by us beginning January 1, 2022 have been benchmarked to SOFR. Additionally, all of our\nfloating-rate whole loans contain provisions that provide for the transition of the contractual benchmark interest rate to an alternative\nrate.

Additionally, during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, we entered into a loan agreement to finance the acquisition of a student housing complex, which uses SOFR as its\nbenchmark interest rate. At December 31, 2022, we had $1.7 billion of floating rate borrowings, 75.8% or $1.3 billion of which have\ninterest rates tied to LIBOR and 24.2% or $419.2 million of which have interest rates tied to SOFR.\nWe expect to complete the process of converting our LIBOR-based loans and borrowings to an applicable benchmark interest\nrate during 2023.\nThe transition from LIBOR to SOFR or to another alternative rate may result in financial market disruptions and significant\nincreases in benchmark interest rates, resulting in increased financing costs to us, any of which could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock.

However, the discovery and distribution of vaccines and other treatments for COVID-19 led to a\nrecovery of the global economy and markets worldwide, which resulted in a net reversal of credit losses of $21.3 million during the year\nended December 31, 2021. The ensuing macroeconomic factors, including expected increases in inflation, short-term interest rates,\nenergy prices and continued global supply chain dislocation trending negative, compounded by an increase in portfolio credit risk\nindicated in property-level cash flows that collateralize our loans, resulted in a net provision of expected credit losses of $12.3 million\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022.\nIn addition to our general estimate of credit losses, we may also be required to individually evaluate collateral-dependent loans\nfor credit losses if it has determined that foreclosure or sale of the loan or the underlying collateral is probable.

Depending on\nthe loan\u2019s performance against these various factors, loans are rated on a scale from 1 to 5, with loans rated 1 representing loans with\nthe highest credit quality and loans rated 5 representing the loans with the lowest credit quality. The factors evaluated provide general\ncriteria to monitor credit migration in our loan portfolio; as such, a loan\u2019s rating may improve or worsen, depending on new information\nreceived.\n59",

Performance criteria and loan covenants\nhave required occasional waivers.\n\u2022 Occupancy is not stabilized and the property has a large amount of tenancy rollover.\n5 \u2022 Property performance is significantly worse than underwritten expectations. The loan is not in compliance with loan\ncovenants and performance criteria and may be in default. Expected sale proceeds would not be sufficient to pay off\nthe loan at maturity.\n\u2022 The property has a material vacancy rate and significant rollover of remaining tenants.\n\u2022 An updated appraisal is required upon designation and updated on an as-needed basis.\nAll CRE loans are evaluated for any credit deterioration by debt asset management and certain finance personnel on at least a\nquarterly basis. Historically, mezzanine loans and preferred equity investments may have experienced greater credit risks due to their\nnature as subordinated investments.\nFor the purpose of calculating the quarterly provision for credit losses under CECL, we pool CRE loans based on the underlying\ncollateral property type and utilize a probability of default and loss given default methodology for approximately one year after which\nwe immediately revert to a historical mean loss ratio. In order to calculate the historical mean loss ratio, we utilize our full, 16 year\nunderwriting history in the determination of historical losses, along with the market loss history from a selected population from an\nengaged third-party provider\u2019s database that were similar to our loan types, loan sizes, durations, interest rate structure and general LTV\nprofiles.\nCredit risk profiles of CRE loans, at amortized cost, were as follows (in thousands, except amounts in the footnote):\nRating 1 Rating 2 Rating 3 Rating 4 Rating 5 Total (1)\nAt December 31, 2022:\nWhole loans, floating-rate $ \u2014 $ 1,635,376 309,491 $ 85,226 $ 22,797 $ 2,052,890\nMezzanine loan \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 4,700 4,700\nTotal $ \u2014 $ 1,635,376 $ 309,491 $ 85,226 $ 27,497 $ 2,057,590\nAt December 31, 2021:\nWhole loans, floating-rate $ \u2014 $ 1,456,330 $ 273,078 $ 123,762 $ 24,681 $ 1,877,851\nMezzanine loan \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 4,700 \u2014 4,700\nTotal $ \u2014 $ 1,456,330 $ 273,078 $ 128,462 $ 24,681 $ 1,882,551\n(1) The total amortized cost of CRE loans excluded accrued",

That receipt\nwas offset by a $814,000 increase in other prepaid expenses, resulting from the prepayment of property taxes on a hotel property acquired\nin November 2020 and two office properties acquired in October 2021.\nDeferred Tax Assets\nAt both December 31, 2022 and 2021, our net deferred tax asset was zero, resulting from a full valuation allowance of $21.2\nmillion and $21.4 million, respectively, on our gross deferred tax asset as we believed it was more likely than not that some or all of the\ndeferred tax assets would not be realized. We will continue to evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax\nassets by analyzing forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing\ntemporary differences, taxable income in prior carry back years (if permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies.\nDerivative Instruments\nHistorically, a significant market risk to us was interest rate risk. We had sought to manage the extent to which net income\nchanges as a result of fluctuation of changes in interest rates by matching adjustable-rate assets with variable-rate borrowings. We sought\nto mitigate the potential impact on net income (loss) of adverse fluctuations in interest rates incurred on our borrowings by entering into\nhedging agreements. We classified our interest rate hedges as cash flow hedges, which are hedges that eliminate the risk of changes in\nthe cash flows of a financial asset or liability.\nWe terminated all of our interest rate swap positions associated with our prior financed CMBS portfolio in April 2020. At\ntermination, we realized a loss of $11.8 million.

The Mortgage matures in April\n2025, subject to two one-year extension options.\nThe Mortgage contains events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods, customary for this type of\nfinancing arrangement. The remedies for such events of default are also customary for this type of transaction.\nConstruction Loan\nIn January 2023, Chapel Drive East, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the FSU Student Venture, entered into a loan\nagreement (the \"Construction Loan Agreement\") with Oceanview Life and Annuity Company (\"Oceanview\") to finance the construction\nof a student housing complex (the \"Construction Loan\"). The Construction Loan is interest only and has a maximum principal balance\nof $48.0 million. The Construction Loan charges one-month Term SOFR plus a spread of 6.00% and matures in February 2025, subject\nto three one-year extension options.\nIn addition to the Construction Loan, we entered into a financing agreement with Florida Pace Funding Agency to fund energy\nefficient building improvements and has a maximum principal balance of $15.5 million.

    "text": "We utilize a variety of financing arrangements to finance certain assets. We generally utilize the following five types of\nfinancing arrangements:\n1. Senior Secured Financing Facility: Our senior secured financing facility allows us to borrow against loans and real estate\ninvestments that we own. This facility has an individual floating rate loan series structure that have a three month\ncommitment period after the financing is approved by the lender, subject to the maximum dollar amount agreed upon for\nthe series. Each floating rate loan series will have mutually agreed upon terms including (i) total commitment, including\nthe capacity to fund future funding commitments, where applicable; (ii) advance rate on portfolio assets; (iii) interest rate\ncomposed of one-month Term SOFR plus a market rate spread; and (iv) maturity date of five years from the issuance date\nfor the loan series unless an additional time is mutually agreed upon by the parties. The facility has a maximum portfolio\nLTV of 85% and contains customary events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods,\ncustomary for this type of financing arrangement.\n2. Term Warehouse Financing Facilities (CRE loans): Term warehouse financing facilities effectively allow us to borrow\nagainst loans that we own. Under these agreements, we transfer loans to a counterparty and agree to purchase the same\nloans from the counterparty at a price equal to the transfer price plus interest. The counterparty retains the sole discretion\nover both whether to purchase the loan from us and, subject to certain conditions, the collateral value of such loan for\npurposes of determining whether we are required to pay margin to the counterparty. Generally, if the lender determines\n(subject to certain conditions) that the value of the collateral in a repurchase transaction has decreased by more than a\ndefined minimum amount, we would be required to repay any amounts borrowed in excess of the product of (i) the revised\ncollateral or market value multiplied by (ii) the applicable advance rate. During the term of these agreements, we receive\nthe principal and interest on the related loans and pay interest to the counterparty.\n3. Securitizations: We seek non-recourse long-term financing from securitizations of our investments in CRE loans. The\nsecuritizations generally involve a senior portion of our loan but may involve the entire loan. Securitization generally\ninvolves transferring notes to a special purpose vehicle (or the issuing entity), which then issues one or more classes of\nnon-recourse notes pursuant to the terms of an indenture. The notes are secured by the pool of assets. In exchange for the\ntransfer of assets to the issuing entity, we receive cash proceeds from the sale of non-recourse notes. Securitizations of our\nportfolio investments might magnify our exposure to losses on those portfolio investments because the retained subordinate\ninterest in any particular overall loan would be subordinate to the loan components sold and we would, therefore, absorb\nall losses sustained with respect to the overall loan before the owners of the senior notes experience any losses with respect\nto the loan in question.\n4. Mortgage payable: We have entered into a loan agreement to finance the acquisition of a student housing complex. This\nloan is interest only and has a maximum principal balance, most of which was advanced in the initial funding. The loan\nagreement contains events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods, customary for this type",

The loan agreement contains events of default,\nsubject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods, customary for this type of financing arrangement. The remedies\nfor such events of default are also customary for this type of transaction. Additionally, we have entered into a financing\nagreement to fund energy efficient building improvements at this student housing complex, with a maximum principal\nbalance of $15.5 million.\nThe issuances of ACR 2021-FL1 and ACR 2021-FL2 include 24-month reinvestment periods ending in May 2023 and\nDecember 2023, respectively, that allow us to reinvest CRE loan payoffs and paydowns into the securitizations upon the satisfaction of\ncertain eligibility and reinvestment criteria along with rating agency approval. The reinvestment feature of the securitizations will allow\nus to extend the securitizations\u2019 financing capability by increasing the useful lives of the senior notes through the reinvestment of loan\nproceeds into new loans. We are also able to acquire future funding participations of the collateral in the securitizations during the\nreinvestment period.\nWe were in compliance with all of our covenants at December 31, 2022 in accordance with the terms provided in agreements\nwith our lenders.\nWe are continuing to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on us, the borrowers underlying our commercial real\nestate-related loans (and their tenants), our financing sources, and the economy as a whole. Because the severity, magnitude and duration\nof the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict, the pandemic\u2019s\nimpact on our operations and liquidity remains uncertain and difficult to predict.

The leverage ratio increase\nthrough December 31, 2022 was primarily attributable to the net increase in asset specific borrowing while being offset by the payoff\nof our 4.50% convertible senior notes and leverage also increased due to the net decrease in total equity primarily from our common\nstock repurchase program.\nNet Operating Losses and Loss Carryforwards\nThe following table sets forth the net operating losses and loss carryforwards for the periods presented (in millions):\nTax Year\nRecognized REIT (QRS) Tax Loss Carryforwards TRS Tax Loss Carryforwards\nTax Asset Item Operating Capital Operating Capital\nNet Operating Loss\nCarryforwards:\nCumulative as of 2021 2021 Return $ 46.6 $ \u2014 $ 60.1 $ \u2014\nNet Capital Loss Carryforwards:\nCumulative as of 2021 2021 Return \u2014 121.9 \u2014 1.0\nTotal tax asset estimates $ 46.6 $ 121.9 $ 60.1 $ 1.0\nUseful life Unlimited 5 years Various 5 years\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated $1.1 million of taxable income which was offset by our cumulative\nnet operating losses (\u201cNOL\u201d), leaving $46.6 million to carry forward to future years.

No capital losses expired\nduring 2021 or 2022.\nWe also have tax assets in our taxable REIT subsidiaries (\u201cTRS\u201d). These tax assets are analyzed and disclosed quarterly in our\nfinancial statements. As of December 31, 2021, our TRSs have $39.9 million of pre-TCJA NOLs, some of which are set to expire\nbeginning in 2044, $20.2 million of NOLs with an indefinite carryforward period and net capital loss carryforwards of $1.0 million.\nDistributions\nWe did not pay distributions on our common shares during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 as we were\nfocused on prudently retaining and managing sufficient excess liquidity in connection with the economic impact of the COVID-19\npandemic. As a result of losses during that year, we received significant NOL carryforwards and net capital loss carryforwards, as\nfinalized in our 2020 tax return. We intend to retain taxable income by utilizing our NOL carryforwards and expect to generate capital\ngains to use a portion of our net capital loss carryforwards, thereby growing book value and our investable equity base. As we continue\nto take steps necessary to stabilize our earnings available for distribution, our Board will establish a plan for the prudent resumption of\nthe payment of common share distributions. No assurance, however, can be given as to the amounts or timing of future distributions as\nsuch distributions are subject to our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and such other factors as our Board deems\nrelevant.\nWe intend to continue to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of our preferred stock.\nU.S. federal income tax law generally requires that a REIT distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income annually,\ndetermined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and that it pay tax at regular corporate\nrates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100% of its taxable income. Before we pay any dividend, whether for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes or otherwise, we must first meet both our operating and debt service requirements on our repurchase agreements\nand other debt payable. If our cash available for distribution is less than our taxable income, we could be required to sell assets or borrow\nfunds to make cash distributions, or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or\ndistribution of debt securities.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nContractual Commitments\n(dollars in thousands, except amounts in footnotes)\nPayments due by Period\nLess than 1 More than 5\nTotal year 1 - 3 years 3 - 5 years years\nAt December 31, 2022:\nCRE securitizations $ 1,242,223 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 1,242,223\nSenior secured financing facility (1) 91,549 \u2014 \u2014 91,549 \u2014\nCRE - term warehouse financing facilities (2)(3) 330,",

Except as set forth below, at December 31, 2022, we had\nnot guaranteed obligations of any unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or letter of intent to provide additional funding\nto any such entities.\nUnfunded CRE Loan Commitments\nIn the ordinary course of business, we make commitments to borrowers whose loans are in our CRE loan portfolio to provide\nadditional loan funding in the future. Disbursement of funds pursuant to these commitments is subject to the borrower meeting pre-\nspecified criteria. These commitments are subject to the same underwriting requirements and ongoing portfolio maintenance as are the\non-balance sheet financial investments that we hold. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total\ncommitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Whole loans had $158.2 million and $157.6 million in\nunfunded loan commitments at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Preferred equity investments had $2.5 million in unfunded\ninvestment commitments at December 31, 2020.

As such, we may be obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party based on another entity\u2019s failure to perform\nor achieve specified performance criteria, or we may have an indirect guarantee of the indebtedness of others.\nAs part of our May 2017 sale of our equity interest in Pearlmark Mezz, we entered into an indemnification agreement whereby\nwe indemnified the purchaser against realized losses of up to $4.3 million on one mezzanine loan until its final maturity date in 2020.\nAs a result of the indemnified party\u2019s partial sale of the mezzanine loan, our maximum exposure was reduced to $536,000 in 2019.

    "text": "Allowance for Credit Losses\nWe maintain an allowance for credit loss on our loans held for investment. CRE loans that are held for investment are carried\nat cost, net of unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts, loan fees and origination costs as applicable. Effective January 1, 2020,\nwe determine our allowance for credit losses, consistent with GAAP, by measuring CECL on the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis. We\nutilize a probability of default and loss given default methodology over a reasonable and supportable forecast period after which we\nrevert to the historical mean loss ratio, utilizing a blended approach sourced from our own historical losses and the market losses from\nan engaged third party\u2019s database, to be applied for the remaining estimable period. The CECL model requires us to make significant\njudgments, including: (i) the selection of a reasonable and supportable forecast period, (ii) the selection and weighting of appropriate\nmacroeconomic forecast scenarios, (iii) projections for the amounts and timing of future fundings of committed balances and\nprepayments on CRE investments, (iv) the determination of the risk characteristics in which to pool financial assets, and (v) the\nappropriate historical loss data to use in the model. Unfunded commitments are not considered in the CECL reserve if they are\nunconditionally cancellable by us.\nWe measure the loan portfolio\u2019s credit losses by grouping loans based on similar risk characteristics under CECL, which is\ntypically based on the loan\u2019s collateral type. We regularly evaluate the risk characteristics of our loan portfolio to determine whether a\ndifferent pooling methodology is more accurate. Further, if we determine that foreclosure of a loan\u2019s collateral is probable or repayment\nof the loan is expected through sale or operation of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, expected credit\nlosses are measured as the difference between the current fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost of the loan. Fair value may\nbe determined based on (i) the present value of estimated cash flows; (ii) the market price, if available; or (iii) the fair value of the\ncollateral less estimated disposition costs.\nWhile a loan exhibiting credit quality deterioration may remain on accrual status, the loan is placed on non-accrual status at\nsuch time as (i) management believes that scheduled debt service payments will not be met within the coming 12 months; (ii) the loan\nbecomes 90 days past due; (iii) management determines the borrower is incapable of, or has ceased efforts toward, curing the cause of\nthe credit deterioration; or (iv) the net realizable value of the loan\u2019s underlying collateral approximates our carrying value for such loan.\nWhile on non-accrual status, we recognize interest income only when an actual payment is received if a credit analysis supports the\nborrower\u2019s principal repayment capacity. When a loan is placed on non-accrual, previously accrued interest is reversed from interest\nincome.\nWe utilize the contractual life of our loans to estimate the period over which we measure expected credit losses. Estimates for\nprepayments and extensions are incorporated into the inputs for our CECL model. Modifications to loan terms, such as a modification\nin connection with a TDR, where a concession is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, may result in the extension of\nthe loan\u2019s life and an increase in the allowance for credit",

Modifications to loan terms, such as a modification\nin connection with a TDR, where a concession is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, may result in the extension of\nthe loan\u2019s life and an increase in the allowance for credit losses. In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d)\nconcurred with a joint statement of federal and state banking regulators that eased the requirements to classify a modification as a TDR\nif the modification was granted in connection with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The measurement of the impact of TDRs on\nthe expected credit losses occurs when a TDR is reasonably expected. If the concession granted on a TDR can only be captured through\na discounted cash flow analysis, then we will individually assess the loan for expected credit losses using the discounted cash flow\nmethod.\nIn order to calculate the historical mean loss ratio applied to the loan portfolio, we utilize historical losses from our full\nunderwriting history, along with the market loss history of a selected population of loans from a third party\u2019s database that are similar\nto our loan types, loan sizes, durations, interest rate structure and general LTV profiles. We may make adjustments to the historical loss\nhistory for qualitative or environmental factors if we believe there is evidence that the estimate for expected credit losses should be\nincreased or decreased.\nWe record write-offs against the allowance for credit losses if we deem that all or a portion of a loan\u2019s balance is uncollectible.\nIf we receive cash in excess of some or all of the amounts we previously wrote off, we record a recovery to increase the allowance for\ncredit losses.\nAs part of the evaluation of the loan portfolio, we assess the performance of each loan and assign a risk rating based on the\ncollective evaluation of several factors, including but not limited to: collateral performance relative to underwritten plan, time since\norigination, current implied and/or re-underwritten LTV ratios, risk inherent in the loan structure and exit plan. Loans are rated \u201c1\u201d\nthrough \u201c5,\u201d from least risk to greatest risk, in connection with this review.\nPrior to the implementation of CECL, we calculated our allowance for credit losses through the calculation of general and\nspecific reserves. The general reserve, established for loans not determined to be impaired individually, was based on our loan risk\nratings. We recorded a general reserve equal to 1.5% of the aggregate face values of loans with a risk rating of \u201c3,\u201d plus 5.0% of the\naggregate face values of loans with a risk rating of \u201c4.\u201d Loans with a risk rating of \u201c5\u201d were individually measured for impairment to be\nincluded in a specific reserve on a quarterly basis.\n78",

Acquired investments in real estate assets are recorded initially\nat fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We allocate the purchase price of our acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on the\nrelative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nWe evaluate whether property obtained as a result of our lending activities should be identified as held for sale. If a property is\ndetermined to be held for sale, all of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities will be recorded in property held for sale on the\nconsolidated balance sheets and recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Once a property is classified as held for sale, depreciation\nexpense is no longer recorded.\nInvestments in real estate are carried net of accumulated depreciation. We depreciate real property, building and tenant\nimprovements and furniture, fixtures, and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We\namortize any acquired intangible assets using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets. We\namortize the value allocated to lease right of use assets and related in-place lease liabilities, when determined to be operating leases,\nusing the straight-line method over the remaining lease term. The value allocated to any associated above or below market lease\nintangible asset or liability is amortized to lease expense over the remaining lease term.\nOrdinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into income using the effective yield method. If a loan\nwith a premium or discount is prepaid, we immediately recognize the unamortized portion as a decrease or increase to interest income.\nIn addition, we defer loan origination and extension fees and loan origination costs and recognize them over the life of the related loan\nwith interest income using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective yield method. Income recognition is suspended\nfor loans at the earlier of the date at which payments become 90 days past due or when, in our opinion, a full recovery of principal and\nincome becomes doubtful. When the ultimate collectability of the principal is in doubt, all payments received are applied to principal\nunder the cost recovery method.

We\nrecognize hotel operating revenue when guest rooms are occupied, services have been provided or fees have been earned. Revenues are\nrecorded net of any sales, occupancy or other taxes collected from customers on behalf of third parties. The following provides additional\ndetail on room revenue and other operating revenue:\n\u2022 Room revenue is recognized when our hotel satisfies its performance obligation of providing a hotel room. The hotel reservation\ndefines the terms of the agreement including an agreed-upon rate and length of stay. Payment is typically due and paid in full\nat the end of the stay with some customers prepaying for their rooms prior to the stay. Payments received from a customer prior\nto arrival are recorded as an advance deposit and are recognized as revenue at the time of occupancy.\n\u2022 Other operating revenue is recognized at the time when the goods or services are provided to the customer or when the\nperformance obligation is satisfied. Payment is due at the time that goods or services are rendered or billed.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe consolidate entities that are VIEs where we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of such entities. Once it\nis determined that we hold a variable interest in a VIE, management performs a qualitative analysis to determine (i) if we have the power\nto direct the matters that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s financial performance; and (ii) if we have the obligation to absorb the\nlosses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive the benefits of the VIE that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIE. If our variable interest possesses both of these characteristics, we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and\nwould be required to consolidate the VIE. This assessment must be done on an ongoing basis.\nAt December 31, 2022, we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of five VIEs that are consolidated.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Standards Adopted in 2022\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued guidance that removes certain separation models\nfor convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock that require the separation into a debt component and an equity or\nderivative component. Consequently, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized\ncost, if no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives and the convertible instrument is not issued with substantial\npremiums accounted for as paid-in capital. By removing those separation models, the interest rate of convertible debt instruments\ntypically will be closer to the coupon interest rate. The guidance also revises the derivative scope exception for contracts in an entity\u2019s\nown equity and improves the consistency of EPS calculations. Adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nAccounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Periods\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued an amendment eliminating certain previously issued accounting guidance for troubled debt\nrestructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d) and enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding refinancings, restructurings, and write-offs. Current GAAP\nprovides an exception to general recognition and measurement guidance for loan restructurings if they meet specific criteria to be\nconsidered TDRs. If a modification is a TDR, incremental expected losses are recorded in the allowance for credit",

The new amendment eliminates the TDR recognition and measurement guidance and\nrequires the reporting entity to evaluate whether the modification represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan, consistent\nwith accounting for other loan modifications. The amendment also requires public business entities to disclose current-period gross\nwrite-offs by year of origination for certain financing receivables and net investments in leases. For entities that have adopted the\npreviously issued guidance amended by this update, which we did during the year ended December 31, 2020, this update is effective for\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for\nentities that have adopted the previously issued guidance amended by this update. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this\nguidance.\nInflation\nVirtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence\nour performance far more than does inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in\ninflation rates. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and our distributions are determined by\nour Board based primarily on our maintaining our REIT qualification; in each case, our activities and balance sheet are measured with\nreference to historical cost and/or fair market value without considering inflation.\n80",

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAt December 31, 2022, the primary components of our market risk were credit risk, counterparty risk, financing risk and interest\nrate risk, as described below. While we do not seek to avoid risk completely, we do seek to assume risk that can be quantified from\nhistorical experience, to actively manage that risk, to earn sufficient compensation to justify assuming that risk and to maintain capital\nlevels consistent with the risk we undertake or to which we are exposed.\nCredit Risks\nOur loans and investments are subject to credit risk. The performance and value of our loans and investments depend upon the\nsponsors\u2019 ability to operate the properties that serve as our collateral so that they produce cash flows adequate to pay interest and\nprincipal due to us. To monitor this risk, ACRES Capital, LLC\u2019s asset management team reviews our investment portfolios and in certain\ninstances is in regular contact with our borrowers, monitoring performance of the collateral and enforcing our rights as necessary.\nIn addition, we are exposed to the risks generally associated with the commercial real estate (\u201cCRE\u201d) market, including\nvariances in occupancy rates, capitalization rates, absorption rates, and other macroeconomic factors beyond our control. We seek to\nmanage these risks through our underwriting and asset management processes.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the CRE markets as numerous state, local, and federal regulations were issued\nthat imposed restrictions on travel and economic activity to contain the spread of the contagion, causing reduced occupancy, requests\nfrom tenants for rent deferral or abatement, and delays in construction and development projects. While many of these restrictions have\nbeen lifted, the reduced economic activity experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic could still severely impact borrowers\u2019\nbusinesses, financial condition and liquidity and may result in borrowers being unwilling or unable to meet their obligations to us in part\nor in full.\nIn a business environment where benchmark interest rates are increasing significantly, cash flows of the CRE assets underlying\nour loans may not be sufficient to pay debt service on our loans, which could result in non-performance or default. We partially mitigate\nthis risk by generally requiring our borrowers to purchase interest rate cap agreements with non-affiliated, well-capitalized third parties\nand by selectively requiring our borrowers to have and maintain debt service reserves. These interest rate caps generally mature prior to\nthe maturity date of the loan and the borrowers are required to pay to extend them. In most cases the sponsors will need to fund additional\nequity into the properties to cover these costs as the property may not generate sufficient cash flow to pay these costs. At December 31,\n2022, 88.8% of par value of our CRE loan portfolio had interest rate caps in place with a weighted-average maturity of 1.1 years.\nThese macroeconomic conditions may persist into the future and impair our borrowers\u2019 ability to comply with the terms under\nour loan agreements. We maintain a robust asset management relationship with our borrowers and have utilized these relationships",

We maintain a robust asset management relationship with our borrowers and have utilized these relationships to\naddress the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising interest rates and other macroeconomic factors on our loans secured\nby properties experiencing cash flow pressure. While we believe the principal amounts of our loans are generally adequately protected\nby underlying collateral value, there is a risk that we will not realize the entire principal value of certain investments. In order to mitigate\nthat risk, we have proactively engaged with our borrowers, particularly with those with near-term maturities, in order to maximize\nrecovery.\nCounterparty Risk\nThe nature of our business requires us to hold our cash and cash equivalents and obtain financing from with various financial\ninstitutions. This exposes us to the risk that these financial institutions may not fulfill their obligations to us under these various\ncontractual arrangements. We mitigate this exposure by depositing our cash and cash equivalents and entering into financing agreements\nwith high credit-quality institutions.\nFinancing Risk\nWe finance our target assets using our CRE debt securitizations, a senior secured financing facility and warehouse financing\nfacilities. Over time, as market conditions change, we may use other forms of leverage in addition to these methods of financing.\nWeakness or volatility in the financial markets, the CRE and mortgage markets or the economy generally, such as through the impact\nof the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect one or more of our lenders or potential lenders and could cause one or more of our\nlenders or potential lenders to be unwilling or unable to provide us with financing, or to decrease the amount of our available financing,\nor to increase the costs of that financing.\n81",

    "text": "Interest Rate Risk\nOur business model is such that rising interest rates will increase our net income, while declining interest rates will decrease\nnet income, subject to the impact of interest rate floors. As of December 31, 2022, 99.8% of our CRE loan portfolio by par value earned\na floating rate of interest and may be financed with liabilities that both pay interest at floating rates and that are fixed. Floating-rate loans\nfinanced with fixed rate liabilities have a negative correlation with declining interest rates to the extent of our financing. The remaining\n0.2% of our CRE loan portfolio by par value earned a fixed rate of interest and may be financed with liabilities that pay interest at fixed\nrates. To the extent that interest rate floors on our floating-rate CRE loans are in the money, our net interest will have a negative\ncorrelation with rising interest rates to the extent of those interest rate floors. Our floating-rate loan portfolio of $2.1 billion has a\nweighted-average one-month LIBOR floor of 0.68% at December 31, 2022.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error\nor fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding\nthe amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

The Company measures lifetime expected credit losses on CRE whole loans on\na pooled basis, based on shared risk characteristics or individually for collateral-dependent loans. To estimate the allowance for credit\nlosses on pooled CRE whole loans, the Company utilizes a probability of default times loss given default methodology, which\nincorporates individual loan characteristics, historical loss experience and the weighting of forecasted economic scenarios. For loans\ndetermined to be collateral-dependent that are individually evaluated, the reserve is calculated based on the difference between the\ncurrent fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost of the loan. We identified the allowance for credit losses as a critical audit\nmatter.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that the allowance for credit losses is a critical audit matter are that management is\nrequired to make significant judgments in determining the accuracy of loan level data input into the estimate, the weighing of the\nforecasted economic scenarios, and in evaluating whether factors are present that indicate if an individual loan does not share risk\ncharacteristics of the pool.

On July 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s\nmanagement contract was acquired from Exantas Capital Manager Inc. (the \u201cPrior Manager\u201d), a subsidiary of C-III Capital Partners\nLLC (\u201cC-III\u201d), by ACRES Capital, LLC (the \u201cManager\u201d), a subsidiary of ACRES Capital Corp. (collectively, \u201cACRES\u201d), a private\ncommercial real estate lender exclusively dedicated to nationwide middle market CRE lending with a focus on multifamily, student\nhousing, hospitality, office and industrial property in top United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) markets (the \u201cACRES acquisition\u201d).\nThe Company has qualified, and expects to qualify in the current fiscal year, as a REIT.\nThe Company conducts its operations through the use of subsidiaries that it consolidates into its financial statements. The\nCompany\u2019s core assets are consolidated through its investment in ACRES Realty Funding, Inc. (\u201cACRES RF\u201d), a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary that holds CRE loans, CRE-related securities and investments in CRE securitizations, which are consolidated as VIEs as\ndiscussed in Note 3, and special purpose entities.\nReverse Stock Split\nEffective February 16, 2021, the Company completed a one-for-three reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock. The\naccompanying financial statements and notes to the financial statements give retroactive effect to the reverse stock split for all periods\npresented. In addition, the Company adopted articles of amendment to its charter, which provided that the par value of the Company\u2019s\ncommon stock remained $0.001 immediately after effect was given for the reverse stock split. No fractional shares were issued in\nconnection with the reverse stock split. Stockholders who otherwise held fractional shares of the Company\u2019s common stock as a result\nof the reverse stock split received a cash payment in lieu of such fractional shares.\nIn May 2021, the Company adopted articles of amendment to its charter to decrease its authorized shares of capital stock from\n225,000,000 shares, consisting of 125,000,000 shares of common stock and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock to 141,666,666 shares\nconsisting of 41,666,666 shares of common stock and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock.\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the U.S. (\u201cGAAP\u201d).

A VIE\nis required to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party that (a) has the power to control the activities that\nmost significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance and (b) has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially\nbe significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nThe Company considers the following criteria in determining whether an entity is a VIE:\n1. The equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated\nfinancial support provided by any parties, including the equity holders.\n2. The equity investors lack one or more of the following essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest.\na.

The right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity. The equity investors have voting rights that are not\nproportionate to their economic interests, and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an\ninvestor with a disproportionately small voting interest.\nIn determining whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Company reviews governing contracts, formation\ndocuments and any other contractual arrangements for any relevant terms and determines the activities that have the most significant\nimpact on the VIE and who has the power to direct those activities. The Company also looks for kick-out rights, protective rights and\nparticipating rights as well as any financial or other support provided to the VIE and the reason for that support, and the terms of any\nexplicit or implicit arrangements that may require the Company to provide future support. The Company then makes a determination\nbased on its power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and/or a financial interest that is potentially significant. In instances\nwhen a VIE is owned by both the Company and related parties, the Company considers whether there is a single party in the related\nparty group that meets both the power and losses or benefits criteria on its own as though no related party relationship existed. If one\nparty within the related party group meets both these criteria, such reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of the VIE and no further\nanalysis is needed. If no party within the related party group on its own meets both the power and losses or benefits criteria, but the\nrelated party group as a whole meets these two criteria, the determination of primary beneficiary within the related party group is based\nupon an analysis of the facts and circumstances with the objective of determining which party is most closely associated with the VIE.\nDetermining the primary beneficiary requires significant judgment. The Company continuously analyzes entities in which it holds\nvariable interests, including when there is a reconsideration event, to determine whether such entities are VIEs and whether such potential\nVIEs should be consolidated or deconsolidated.\nVoting Interest Entities\nA voting interest entity is an entity in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable it to finance its activities\nindependently and the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic\nperformance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The usual condition\nfor a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. If the Company has a majority\nvoting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity will generally be consolidated. The Company does not consolidate a voting interest\nentity if there are substantive participating rights by other parties and/or kick-out rights by a single party or through a simple majority\nvote.\nThe Company performs on-going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the voting interest framework\nhave become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the",

Under the cost method, the Company records dividend\nincome when declared to the extent it is not considered a return of capital, which is recorded as a reduction of the cost of the investment.\nLoans\nThe Company acquires loans through direct origination and occasionally through purchases from third-parties and had\nhistorically acquired corporate leveraged loans in the secondary market and through syndications of newly originated loans. Loans are\nheld for investment; therefore, the Company initially records loans at the amount funded for originated loans or at the acquisition price\nfor loans purchased, and subsequently, accounts for them based on their outstanding principal plus or minus unamortized premiums or\ndiscounts. The Company may sell a loan held for investment where the credit fundamentals underlying a particular loan have changed\nin such a manner that the Company\u2019s expected return on investment may decrease. Once the determination has been made by the\nCompany that it no longer will hold the loan for investment, the Company identifies these loans as loans held for sale. Any credit-related\nwrite-off considerations prior to the transfer of the loan to loans held for sale are accounted for through the allowance for credit losses\non the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company reports its loans held for sale at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. To determine fair value, the Company\nprimarily uses appraisals of underlying collateral obtained from third-parties as a practical expedient. Key assumptions used in those\nappraisals are reviewed by the Company. If there is a material difference between the value provided by the appraiser and information\nused by the Company to validate the appraisal, the Company will evaluate the difference with the appraiser, which could result in an\nupdated appraisal. The Company may also use the present value of estimated cash flows, market price, if available, or other determinants\nof the fair value of the collateral less estimated disposition costs. Any determined changes in the fair value of loans held for sale are\nrecorded in fair value adjustments on financial assets held for sale on the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations. Based on a\nprioritization of inputs used in the valuation of each position, the Company categorizes these investments as either Level 2 or Level 3\nin the fair value hierarchy.\nLoan Interest Income Recognition\nInterest income on loans includes interest at stated rates adjusted for amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts based\non the contractual payment terms of the loan.

Based on a\nprioritization of inputs used in the valuation of each position, the Company categorizes these investments as either Level 2 or Level 3\nin the fair value hierarchy.\nLoan Interest Income Recognition\nInterest income on loans includes interest at stated rates adjusted for amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts based\non the contractual payment terms of the loan. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into income using the effective yield\nmethod. If a loan with a premium or discount is prepaid, the Company immediately recognizes the unamortized portion as a decrease or\nincrease to interest income. In addition, the Company defers loan origination and extension fees and loan origination costs and recognizes\nthem over the life of the related loan against interest income using the straight line method, which approximates the effective yield\nmethod. Income recognition is suspended for loans at the earlier of the date at which payments become 90 days past due or when, in the\nopinion of management, a full recovery of principal and income becomes doubtful. When the ultimate collectability of the principal is\nin doubt, all payments received are applied to principal under the cost recovery method. On the other hand, when the ultimate\ncollectability of the principal is not in doubt, contractual interest is recorded as interest income when received, under the cash method,\nuntil an accrual is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed. A loan is\nwritten off when it is no longer realizable and/or legally discharged.\nThe Company records interest receivable on its loans in accrued interest receivable on its consolidated balance sheets. The\nCompany analyzes the interest receivable balances on a timely basis, or at least quarterly, to determine if they are uncollectible. If an\ninterest receivable amount is deemed uncollectible, then the Company writes off that uncollectible amount of the interest receivable\nthrough a reversal of interest income.\n97",

    "text": "ACRES COMMERCIAL REALTY CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nDECEMBER 31, 2022\nPreferred Equity Investment\nHistorically, the Company invested in preferred equity investments. Preferred equity investments, which are subordinate to any\nloans but senior to common equity, depending on the investment\u2019s characteristics, could be accounted for as real estate, joint ventures\nor as mortgage loans. The Company\u2019s preferred equity investments were accounted for as CRE loans held for investment, were carried\nat cost, net of unamortized loan fees and origination costs, and were included within CRE loans on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance\nsheets. The Company accreted or amortized any discounts or premiums over the life of the related loan utilizing the effective interest\nmethod. Interest and fees were recognized as income subject to recoverability, which was substantiated by obtaining annual appraisals\non the underlying property.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit loss on its loans held for investment. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company\ndetermines its allowance for credit losses by measuring the current expected credit losses (\u201cCECL\u201d) on the loan portfolio on a quarterly\nbasis. The Company utilizes a probability of default and loss given default methodology together with collateral-specific data for each\nloan over a reasonable and supportable forecast period after which it reverts to its historical mean loss ratio, utilizing a blended approach\nsourced from its own historical losses and the market losses from an engaged third party\u2019s database, to be applied for the remaining\nestimable period. The CECL model requires the Company to make significant judgments, including: (i) the selection of a reasonable\nand supportable forecast period, (ii) the selection and weighting of appropriate macroeconomic forecast scenarios, (iii) projections for\nthe amounts and timing of future fundings of committed balances and prepayments on CRE investments, (iv) the determination of the\nrisk characteristics in which to pool financial assets, and (v) the appropriate historical loss data to use in the model. Unfunded\ncommitments are not considered in the CECL reserve if they are unconditionally cancellable by the Company.\nThe Company measures the loan portfolio\u2019s credit losses by grouping loans based on similar risk characteristics under CECL,\nwhich is typically based on the loan\u2019s collateral type. The Company regularly evaluates the risk characteristics of its loan portfolio to\ndetermine whether a different pooling methodology is more accurate. Further, if the Company determines that foreclosure of a loan\u2019s\ncollateral is probable or repayment of the loan is expected through sale or operation of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing\nfinancial difficulty, expected credit losses are measured as the difference between the current fair value of the collateral and the amortized\ncost of the loan. Fair value may be determined based on (i) the present value of estimated cash flows; (ii) the market price, if available;\nor (iii) the fair value of the collateral less estimated disposition costs.\nWhile a loan exhibiting credit quality deterioration may remain on accrual status, the loan is placed on non-accrual status at\nsuch time as (i) management believes that scheduled debt service payments will not be met within the coming 12 months; (ii) the loan\nbecomes 90 days past due; (iii)",

While on non-accrual status, the Company recognizes interest income only when an actual payment is received if a credit\nanalysis supports the borrower\u2019s principal repayment capacity. When a loan is placed on non-accrual, previously accrued and\nuncollected interest is reversed from interest income.\nThe Company utilizes the contractual life of its loans to estimate the period over which it measures expected credit losses.\nEstimates for prepayments and extensions are incorporated into the inputs for the Company\u2019s CECL model. Modifications to loan terms,\nsuch as a modification in connection with a troubled debt restructuring (\u201cTDR\u201d), where a concession is granted to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty, may result in the extension of the loan\u2019s life and an increase in the allowance for credit losses. In March\n2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) concurred with a joint statement of federal and state banking regulators that\neased the requirements to classify a modification as a TDR if the modification was granted in connection with the effects of the COVID-\n19 pandemic. If the concession granted on a TDR can only be captured through a discounted cash flow analysis, then the Company will\nindividually assess the loan for expected credit losses using the discounted cash flow method.\nIn order to calculate the historical mean loss ratio applied to the loan portfolio, the Company utilizes historical losses from its\nfull underwriting history, along with the market loss history of a selected population of loans from a third party\u2019s database that are\nsimilar to the Company\u2019s loan types, loan sizes, durations, interest rate structure and general loan-to-collateral value (\u201cLTV\u201d) profiles.\nThe Company may make adjustments to the historical loss history for qualitative or environmental factors if it believes there is evidence\nthat the estimate for expected credit losses should be increased or decreased.\nThe Company records write-offs against the allowance for credit losses if it deems that all or a portion of a loan\u2019s balance is\nuncollectible. If the Company receives cash in excess of some or all of the amounts it previously wrote off, it records the recovery by\nincreasing the allowance for credit losses.\n98",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nDECEMBER 31, 2022\nAs part of the evaluation of the loan portfolio, the Company assesses the performance of each loan and assigns a risk rating\nbased on the collective evaluation of several factors, including but not limited to: collateral performance relative to underwritten plan,\ntime since origination, current implied and/or re-underwritten LTV ratios, risk inherent in the loan structure and exit plan. Loans are\nrated \u201c1\u201d through \u201c5,\u201d from the least risk to the greatest risk, in connection with this review.\nPrior to the implementation of CECL, the Company calculated its allowance for credit losses through the calculation of general\nand specific reserves. The general reserve, established for loans not determined to be impaired individually, was based on the Company\u2019s\nloan risk ratings. The Company recorded a general reserve equal to 1.5% of the aggregate face values of loans with a risk rating of \u201c3,\u201d\nplus 5.0% of the aggregate face values of loans with a risk rating of \u201c4.\u201d Loans with a risk rating of \u201c5\u201d were individually measured for\nimpairment to be included in a specific reserve on a quarterly basis.\nOperating Revenue at Properties\nThrough its investments in real estate, the Company earns revenue associated with rental operations and hotel operations, which\nare presented in real estate income on the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s rental operating revenue consists of fixed contractual base rent arising from tenant leases at the Company\u2019s\noffice and student housing properties under operating leases. Revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable\nterms of the related leases. For leases that have fixed and measurable rent escalations, the difference between such rental income earned\nand the cash rent due under the provisions of the lease is recorded in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. The Company moves\nto cash basis operating lease income recognition in the period in which collectability of all lease payments is no longer considered\nprobable. At such time, any uncollectible receivable balance will be written off.\nHotel operating revenue consists of amounts derived from hotel operations, including room sales and other hotel revenues. The\nCompany recognizes hotel operating revenue when guest rooms are occupied, services have been provided or fees have been earned.\nRevenues are recorded net of any sales, occupancy or other taxes collected from customers on behalf of third parties. The following\nprovides additional detail on room revenue and other operating revenue:\n\u2022 Room revenue is recognized when the Company\u2019s hotel satisfies its performance obligation of providing a hotel room.\nThe hotel reservation defines the terms of the agreement including an agreed-upon rate and length of stay. Payment is\ntypically due and paid in full at the end of the stay with some customers prepaying for their rooms prior to the stay.\nPayments received from a customer prior to arrival are recorded as an advance deposit and are recognized as revenue at\nthe time of occupancy.\n\u2022 Other operating revenue is recognized at the time when the goods or services are provided to the customer or when the\nperformance obligation is satisfied.

Acquired investments in real estate assets are recorded\ninitially at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company allocates the purchase price of its acquired assets and assumed\nliabilities based on the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company accounts for leases that it acquires\nas operating leases.\nThe Company evaluates whether property obtained as a result of its lending activities should be identified as held for sale. If a\nproperty is determined to be held for sale, all of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities will be recorded in property held for sale on\nthe consolidation balance sheet and recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, see the \u201cAssets and Liabilities Held for Sale\u201d section\nbelow. Once a property is classified as held for sale, depreciation expense is no longer recorded.\nInvestments in real estate are carried net of accumulated depreciation. The Company depreciates real property, building and\ntenant improvements and furniture, fixtures, and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets\nunless the asset is designated as held for sale. The Company amortizes any acquired intangible assets using the straight-line method over\nthe estimated useful lives of the intangible assets. The Company amortizes the value allocated to lease right of use assets and related in-\nplace lease liabilities, when determined to be operating leases, using the straight-line method over the remaining lease term.

To maintain REIT status for federal income tax purposes, the Company is generally required to distribute\nat least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its shareholders as well as comply with certain other qualification requirements as defined\nunder the Code. As a REIT, the Company is not subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent that it distributes 100% of its REIT\ntaxable income each year.\nTaxable income, from non-REIT activities managed through the Company\u2019s taxable REIT subsidiaries (\u201cTRSs\u201d), is subject to\nfederal, state and local income taxes. The Company\u2019s TRS\u2019 income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under\nthe asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis\nand tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and liabilities and recognizes a\nvaluation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of its deferred tax assets will not be\nrealized. In evaluating the realizability of the deferred tax asset or liability, the Company will consider the expected future taxable\nincome, existing and projected book to tax differences as well as tax planning strategies. This analysis is inherently subjective, as it is\nbased on forecasted earning and business and economic activity. Changes in estimates of deferred tax asset realizability, if any, are\nincluded in income tax (expense) benefit on the consolidated statements of operations.\nIn addition, several of the Company\u2019s foreign TRSs, are organized as exempted companies incorporated with limited liability\nunder the laws of the Cayman Islands. Despite their status as TRSs, they generally will not be subject to corporate tax on their earnings\nand no provision for income taxes is required. However, because they are either controlled foreign corporations or passive foreign\ninvestment companies (in which the Company has made a Qualified Electing Fund election), the Company will generally be required\nto include its share of current taxable income from the foreign TRSs in its calculation of REIT taxable income.\nThe Company accounts for taxes assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing\ntransaction (e.g., sales, use, value added) on a net (excluded from revenue) basis.\nThe Company established a full valuation allowance against its net",

This assessment was based on the Company\u2019s cumulative historical losses and uncertainties as to the\namount of taxable income that would be generated in future years in its TRSs.\nThe Company evaluates and recognizes tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon\nexamination by the appropriate taxing authority. A tax position that meets this threshold is measured as the largest amount of benefit\nthat is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

In accordance with GAAP, the fair value of all\nunvested issuances of restricted stock and options is not remeasured after the initial grant date.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d). Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by\ndividing net income (loss) allocable to common shares by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period. Diluted\nEPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted\ninto common stock, where such exercise or conversion would result in a lower EPS amount.\nFair Value Measurements\nIn analyzing the fair value of its investments accounted for on a fair value basis, the Company uses the fair value hierarchy,\nwhich requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair\nvalue. The Company determines fair value based on quoted prices when available or, if quoted prices are not available, through the use\nof alternative approaches, such as discounting the expected cash flows using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality\nand duration of the investment. The hierarchy defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets\nthat are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value inputs are observable.\nLevel 3 - Prices are determined using significant unobservable inputs. In situations where quoted prices or observable inputs\nare unavailable, for example, when there is little or no market activity for an investment at the end of the period, unobservable inputs\nmay be used.\nThe level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is based on the lowest level input\nthat is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy\nrequires significant judgment. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter; depending on various factors, it is possible\nthat an asset or liability may be classified differently from quarter to quarter. Transfers between levels are determined by the Company\nat the end of the reporting period. However, the Company expects that changes in classifications between levels will be rare.\nReference Rate Reform\nHistorically, the Company has used LIBOR as the benchmark interest rate for its floating-rate whole loans and the Company\nhas been exposed to LIBOR through its floating-rate borrowings. Many of its floating-rate whole loans, CRE securitizations and term\nwarehouse financing facilities included one-month LIBOR as the original contractual benchmark interest rate.

In March 2021, the United Kingdom\u2019s, or\nU.K.\u2019s, Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) announced that it would cease publication of the one-week and the two-month USD\nLIBOR immediately after December 31, 2021, and cease publication of the remaining tenors immediately after June 30, 2023. In July\n2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprising large\nU.S. financial institutions, has identified Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR.\nAll variable rate loans originated by the Company beginning January 1, 2022 have been benchmarked to SOFR. Additionally,\nall of its floating-rate whole loans contain provisions that provide for the transition of the contractual benchmark rate to an alternative\nrate. At December 31, 2022, the Company's loan portfolio had a carrying value of $2.0 billion of floating rate loans, 68.3% or $1.4\nbillion of which have interest rates tied to LIBOR and 31.7% or $646.2 million of which have interest rates tied to SOFR.\nIn September 2021 and January 2022, the term warehouse financing facilities with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\u201cJPMorgan\nChase\u201d) and Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC (\u201cMorgan Stanley\u201d), respectively, were amended to allow for the\ntransition to alternative rates, including rates tied to SOFR, subject to benchmark transition events. Additionally, during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company entered into a loan agreement to finance the acquisition of a student housing complex, which uses\nSOFR as its benchmark interest rate. At December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.7 billion of floating rate borrowings, 75.8% or $1.3\nbillion of which have interest rates tied to LIBOR and 24.2% or $419.2 million of which have interest rates tied to SOFR.\n102",

Consequently, a\nconvertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, if no other features require\nbifurcation and recognition as derivatives and the convertible instrument is not issued with substantial premiums accounted for as paid-\nin capital. By removing those separation models, the interest rate of convertible debt instruments typically will be closer to the coupon\ninterest rate. The guidance also revises the derivative scope exception for contracts in an entity\u2019s own equity and improves the\nconsistency of EPS calculations. Adoption did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Periods\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued an amendment eliminating certain previously issued accounting guidance for troubled debt\nrestructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d) and enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding refinancings, restructurings, and write-offs. Current GAAP\nprovides an exception to general recognition and measurement guidance for loan restructurings if they meet specific criteria to be\nconsidered TDRs. If a modification is a TDR, incremental expected losses are recorded in the allowance for credit losses upon\nmodification and specific disclosures are required. The new amendment eliminates the TDR recognition and measurement guidance and\nrequires the reporting entity to evaluate whether the modification represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan, consistent\nwith accounting for other loan modifications. The amendment also requires public business entities to disclose current-period gross\nwrite-offs by year of origination for certain financing receivables and net investments in leases. For entities that have adopted the\npreviously issued guidance amended by this update, which the Company did during the year ended December 31, 2020, this update is\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is\npermitted for entities that have adopted the previously issued guidance amended by this update. The Company is in the process of\nevaluating the impact of this guidance.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the 2020 consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2021 presentation.\nThese reclassifications had no effect on net loss reported.\nNOTE 3 - VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nThe Company has evaluated its loans, investments in unconsolidated entities, liabilities to subsidiary trusts issuing preferred\nsecurities (consisting of unsecured junior subordinated notes), securitizations, guarantees and other financial contracts in order to\ndetermine if they are variable interests in VIEs.

Accordingly, the\nfollowing VIEs are not consolidated in the Company\u2019s financial statements at December 31, 2022. The Company continuously\nreassesses whether it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of its unconsolidated VIEs. The Company\u2019s maximum exposure to risk\nfor each of these unconsolidated VIEs is set forth in the \u201cMaximum Exposure to Loss\u201d column in the table below.\nUnsecured Junior Subordinated Debentures\nThe Company has a 100% interest in the common shares of Resource Capital Trust I (\u201cRCT I\u201d) and RCC Trust II (\u201cRCT II\u201d),\nrespectively, with a value of $1.5 million in the aggregate, or 3.0% of each trust, at December 31, 2022. RCT I and RCT II were formed\nfor the purposes of providing debt financing to the Company. The Company completed a qualitative analysis to determine whether it is\nthe primary beneficiary of each of the trusts and determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of either trust because it does not\nhave the power to direct the activities most significant to the trusts, which include the collection of principal and interest through\nservicing rights. Accordingly, neither trust is consolidated into the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\n104",

This\ntriggered substantial margin calls by the Company\u2019s counterparties and, in certain cases, formal notices of events of default, all of which\nwere withdrawn or rescinded as of April 19, 2020. As a result of these circumstances and the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19\npandemic, substantially all the Company\u2019s remaining CMBS available-for-sale were sold as of April 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred losses of $186.4 million on its CMBS portfolio, including\nrealized losses of $180.3 million primarily attributable to the sale of 67 CMBS as of April 2020. The remaining unrealized losses of\n$6.1 million were recorded on two securities that previously had fair values below the amortized cost bases and which were expected to\nbe sold prior to their recoveries, with an offsetting charge directly to their amortized cost bases. In March 2021, the Company sold these\ntwo positions, resulting in cash proceeds of $3.0 million and gains of $878,000 during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe Company had no remaining CMBS positions at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nNOTE 11 - INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES\nThe Company\u2019s investments in unconsolidated entities at December 31, 2022 and 2021 comprised a 100% interest in the\ncommon shares of RCT I and RCT II with a value of $1.5 million in the aggregate, or 3.0% of each trust.

Fair values of loans with fixed rates are calculated using the net present values of future cash flows, discounted at market\nrates.

These changes in market conditions may adversely impact\nthe Company\u2019s financial performance and are referred to as \u201cmarket risks.\u201d When deemed appropriate, the Company used derivatives\nas a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company\nthrough the use of derivative instruments were interest rate risk and market price risk.\nThe Company also historically managed its interest rate risk with interest rate swaps. Interest rate swaps are contracts between\ntwo parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices.\nThe Company seeks to manage the extent to which net income changes as a function of changes in interest rates by matching\nadjustable-rate assets with variable-rate borrowings.\nThe Company classified its interest rate swap contracts as cash flow hedges, which are hedges that eliminate the risk of changes\nin the cash flows of a financial asset or liability.\nThe Company terminated all of its interest rate swap positions associated with its financed CMBS portfolio in April 2020. At\ntermination, the Company realized a loss of $11.8 million. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had losses of $6.6 million\nand $8.5 million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which will be amortized into earnings over the\nremaining life of the debt. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded amortization expense,\nreported in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations, of $1.8 million, $1.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had an unrealized gain of $256,000 and $347,000, respectively, attributable to\ntwo terminated interest rate swaps in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets, to be accreted into\nearnings over the remaining life of the debt. The Company recorded accretion income, reported in interest expense on the consolidated\nstatements of operations, of $91,000, $91,000 and $92,000 into earnings during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\nThe Company\u2019s prior origination of fixed-rate CRE whole loans exposed it to market pricing risk in connection with the\nfluctuations of market interest rates. As market interest rates increase or decrease, the fair value of the fixed-rate CRE whole loans will\ndecrease or increase accordingly. In order to mitigate this market price risk, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts in\nwhich it pays a fixed rate of interest in exchange for a variable rate of interest, usually three-month LIBOR. Unrealized gains and losses\non the value of these swap contracts were recorded in other income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. In December\n2020, these interest rate swap",

    "text": "Risk Factors Summary\nThe following summarizes the principal factors that make an investment in us speculative or risky, all of which are more fully described in \u201cItem 1A. Risk\nFactors\u201d below. This summary should be read in conjunction with \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and should not be relied upon as an exhaustive summary of the\nmaterial risks facing our business.\nRisks Related to the Business and the Industry\n\u25cf We have incurred significant losses since inception. We expect to incur losses in the future and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability, and\nmay need to raise additional capital to maintain our operations in the future.\n\u25cf Unsettled conditions in the financial and capital markets may restrict our access to funds or cause our associated borrowing costs increase, which might\nadversely affect our operations.\n\u25cf Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter.\n\u25cf Pinnacle z-axis is a new capability, and adoption may be delayed by our potential customers\u2019 unfamiliarity with 3D position, a lack of ecosystem support\n(e.g., specific device sensors, 3D routing) and/or other factors.\n\u25cf Our business plan and, in turn, our ability to generate revenue, depends in large part on end users accessing our services through our customers\u2019\nplatforms.\n\u25cf We face intense competition in our market, especially from competitors that offer their location services for free, which could make it difficult for us to\nacquire and retain customers and end users.\n\u25cf We are heavily reliant on third parties, including AT&T, Verizon and Amazon Web Services for a variety of our products and business operations, as well\nas on a limited number of key vendors for timely supply of components necessary for our offerings.\n\u25cf Our Pinnacle service in smartphones relies on the availability of barometric pressure measurements and 2D location being made available to us or our\ncustomers.\n\u25cf We may not be successful in the evolution of our TerraPoiNT technology to utilize LTE/5G signals, which will increase our costs and may increase the\nchallenge of adopting our services.\n\u25cf Our hybrid architecture, which depends on the use of our transmitters and our ability to calibrate signals transmitted by third parties, is unproven, may not\nperform well and may cost significantly more than our initial estimates.\n\u25cf Our services\u2019 full potential is contingent on our distribution partners\u2019 and customers\u2019 access to a variety of third-party platforms, which creates a number\nof uncertainties and potential risks.\n\u25cf Our services are available within defined network footprints, and if we are not able to deploy new infrastructure, we will not be able to expand our\nservice area.\n\u25cf There is no guarantee that TerraPoiNT service will be sold to commercial or additional government users or achieve broad commercial support in the\nUnited States or internationally.\n\u25cf There is no guarantee that Federal and state government resilient PNT programs will result in procurements that result in the adoption of our services or\nrevenue to us, and the process that may result in such adoption or revenue may be delayed.\n\u25cf Our solutions depend on the use of location by a wide range of applications. Related privacy concerns could damage our reputation and deter current and\npotential users from using our products and applications.\n\u25cf Natural or man-made disasters, including cyber security attacks or terrorist attacks could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\u25cf Actual or perceived disruptions of our information technology systems or data security",

Business.\nOverview\nWe are the market leader in delivering next generation positioning, navigation and timing (\u201cPNT\u201d) solutions that overcome the limitations of existing\nspace-based global positioning system (\u201cGPS\u201d). The impact of GPS on the U.S. economy is approaching $1 trillion annually, according to a NextNav\nextrapolation of our data from a National Institute of Standards and Technology (\u201cNIST\u201d) sponsored study conducted by RTI International (\u201cRTI\u201d), and the\nEuropean Commission has estimated a similar impact on the economy of the European Union in its 2018 budget process. Based on the increasing reliance on\nPNT across many facets of the global economy, the world increasingly requires more accurate and resilient PNT capabilities. PNT resiliency has recently\nemerged as a priority of the U.S. Federal Government, including as a key cyber security vulnerability. Higher performance will continue to expand the reach\nand value of PNT solutions, while resilience is essential to protect the vast economic activity that is reliant on GPS. We are targeting a global addressable\nmarket that is greater than $100 billion.\nWe currently deliver differentiated PNT solutions through our network-based Pinnacle and TerraPoiNT solutions. Our Pinnacle system provides \u201cfloor-\nlevel\u201d altitude service to any device with a barometric pressure sensor, including most off-the-shelf Android and iOS smartphones. This service enables full 3D\nlocation at national scale for the first time. Public safety, autonomous vehicles, electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles (\u201ceVTOLs\u201d), unmanned aerial\nvehicles (\u201cUAVs\u201d), and the app economy all require precise 3D location solutions. Paramedics need to know which apartment a 911 call originated from, ride\nhailing and delivery apps need to know precisely where a customer is standing and game developers need precise 3D location data to deliver next generation\naugmented reality experiences.\nIn early 2021, we launched the first element of our next generation GPS service through initial commercial launch of our nationwide Pinnacle network\nthat was deployed in partnership with AT&T Services, Inc. (\u201cAT&T\u201d). The Pinnacle network provides \u201cfloor-level\u201d altitude data to over 90% of commercial\nstructures over three stories in the U.S. Pinnacle is being utilized by FirstNet\u00ae for public safety. We are currently providing service to Verizon\nCommunications, Inc. (\"Verizon\") as a customer for enhanced 911 (\u201cE911\u201d) services, using our Pinnacle 911 solution. Pinnacle has also been adopted by a\ngrowing number of public safety apps, commercial apps and app development platforms, including Unity Engine, CRG, GeoComm, Rapid Deploy, Central\nSquare, NGA 911, Qualcomm, and the Unreal Engine. We believe that ramp up of customers using our existing Pinnacle network will support revenue growth\nover the coming year.\nOur TerraPoiNT system is a terrestrial-based, encrypted network designed to overcome the limitations inherent in the space-based nature of GPS. GPS is\na faint, unencrypted signal, which is often unavailable indoors, distorted in urban areas and vulnerable to both jamming and spoofing. TerraPoiNT overcomes\nthese limitations through a network of specialized wide area location transmitters that broadcast an encrypted PNT signal on our licensed 900 MHz LMS\nspectrum with a signal that is 100,000 times stronger than GPS.

Further, the TerraPoiNT signal embeds Pinnacle information to provide a full 3D solution. In addition, TerraPoiNT provides\nredundancy for GPS by offering positioning, navigation and NIST-traceable timing services independently. We believe that this backup capability is essential\ndue to the economy\u2019s reliance on GPS for location and precision timing. GPS redundancy is increasingly a U.S. national security priority, and is rising in\npriority in the European Union, non-EU countries in Eastern Europe and in other parts of the world due to both the demonstrated vulnerability and lack of local\ncontrol of space-based signals and systems, highlighted by recent events in the Ukraine. Critical infrastructure, including communications networks and power\ngrids, require a reliable GPS signal for accurate timing. A failure of GPS could be catastrophic, and there is no comprehensive, terrestrial backup that is widely\ndeployed today. TerraPoiNT received the highest scores in testing by the U.S. Department of Transportation reported in 2021 regarding potential PNT backup\nsolutions, in each category tested, and was the only solution evaluated capable of providing the full set of services provided by GPS.\nAs of March 2023, TerraPoiNT is deployed and available, with metro-wide service in the San Francisco Bay Area and select services available in 85 total\nmarkets nationally. It is also in use by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (\u201cNASA\u201d) at its Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA for drone\noperations research and at its Ames facility in Mountain View, CA, leveraging our deployed network in the Bay Area.\n1",

Based in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, Nestwave provides advanced geolocation solutions to Internet of Things (\u201cIoT\u201d) modem and digital signal\nprocessor vendors and end IoT users. We believe that the combination of our technology with Nestwave\u2019s LTE/5G capabilities will allow us to intelligently\ncombine signals from existing terrestrial LTE/5G networks with our own highly synchronized TerraPoiNT system to deliver resilient 3D PNT capabilities with\nexpanded geographic scale at significantly lower deployment costs than a standalone TerraPoiNT system. We also expect the integration of the Nestwave\ntechnology to significantly improve the spectral efficiency of our transmissions and may allow downlink data capacity similar to other LTE/5G systems\noperating over similar spectrum bandwidth. Nestwave is adopting NextNav\u2019s name and has been substantially integrated into existing TerraPoiNT engineering\nand technology efforts.\nWe acquired Nestwave for an enterprise value of $18.0 million and gross consideration value of $19.3 million, consisting of $4.3 million in cash and\n$15.0 million in our common stock. The transaction resulted in the issuance of 4.0 million shares of our common stock upon close, and up to 1.1 million shares\nof common stock upon exercise of certain Nestwave employee options. All such shares are subject to a lock-up expiring on the first anniversary of transaction\nclose.\nSince the inception of NextNav, LLC in 2007, we have secured valuable Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) licenses for a contiguous 8 MHz\nband of 900 MHz LMS spectrum covering approximately 93% of the U.S. population, been granted more than 150 patents related to our systems and services,\nand standardized our TerraPoiNT technology in 3GPP, the global telecommunications standards-setting body.\nWe believe our unique approach to PNT, relying on terrestrial infrastructure deployed at existing wireless tower or antenna locations, provides an\nunrivaled quality-of-service and would be difficult to replicate.\nOur Strategy\nDomestically, we operate primarily as a facilities-based service provider. Our target customers include businesses, including applications developers, and\nadjacent businesses selling PNT products and systems to end users, and Federal, state and local governmental entities. We deploy sensor and broadcast network\ncapabilities, and licenses access to our customers for the data generated by our networks.

In pursuit of our vision for our services to form the standard for global PNT, we have commenced distribution of our\nservices outside of the United States. We are focused on working with partners that can bring local scale as well as access to local authorities\nresponsible for spectrum allocation and national critical infrastructure. Our joint venture in Japan, MetCom, backed by Sony and Kyocera, is\nemblematic of this approach. MetCom has access to significant local facilities to host our Pinnacle and TerraPoiNT infrastructure and has secured initial\naccess to the required spectrum resources from the Japanese government for TerraPoiNT operations. Pinnacle was launched in November 2022 in Japan\nand we anticipate expanded geographic coverage in 2023. Following the launch of service in Japan, and our successful operations in the U.S., we\nanticipate interest from other international markets in the future.\n\u25cf Ensure 3D Location is Market Standard. Our PNT services offer improved accuracy, resiliency and service availability compared to GPS-based\nservices. We have developed our services to be easily integrated into applications, and sold to end users either as part of a standalone application or for\nintermediate services used as part of a system or application (e.g., software development kits (\u201cSDK\u201d) based products for mass-market apps or the\nNASA drone system used as part of their aircraft systems). Our pricing plans are designed to encourage usage and adoption, and are tailored to the use\ncase and business operations of our customers. Given the increasing importance of geolocation services to society and economy, we believe that our\nofferings should become the new standard in geolocation.\n\u25cf Enable a Suite of Complementary Products. As the first to market with a scalable 3D location service, we provide or partner with companies to deliver\nproducts and services that are adjacent to our basic location service. Our first product supporting 3D location is our altimeter software bundled with our\nSDK that enables a quick reference to a user\u2019s relative height. We anticipate building additional tools and capabilities to improve access and usability to\napplication developers to both accelerate adoption and the use of full 3D location.\n\u25cf Enhance Adoption, Distribution and Scale with Strategic Partners. We launched our services after securing our strategic agreement with AT&T to\ndeploy the Pinnacle altitude network and to begin offering services to public safety customers. This relationship provided us with a platform to offer a\nnationwide service capability and to deliver a crucial situational awareness capability to public safety customers as part of AT&T\u2019s FirstNet\u00ae\noperations. Our public safety presence is supported by our own marketing, awareness built through AT&T\u2019s marketing campaigns and its presence on\nthe FirstNet\u00ae API Catalog.\n\u25cf Expand the use of our service for E911 in the U.S. In October 2021, we entered into an agreement with Qualcomm to make our Pinnacle software and\nservices available with the Qualcomm Location Suite, which will make it easier for device vendors to integrate vertical location capabilities into\nexisting carrier E911 infrastructure. We are currently providing service to Verizon as a customer for E911 services, using our Pinnacle 911 solution for\nits customers, and the first device (in partnership with Sonim Technologies Inc.) leveraging this technology became available in December 2022.

    "text": "Industry Background\nPNT services are used in nearly every facet of our economy. Cellular and electrical distribution systems depend on GPS-based timing, the mobile app\neconomy relies on location to create innovative services and to drive data and advertising revenue, and public safety and E911 saves lives every day with the\nuse of location services.\nGPS has powered the global economy for nearly 40 years. Without high-precision timing from GPS, cellular systems would quickly fail and the\ndistribution of electricity would be impacted, while GPS-based location powers everything from aviation and wireless 911 location to the mobile app economy.\nBased on research performed for NIST by RTI in 2019, for example, GPS alone is calculated to have provided nearly $1.4 trillion to the U.S. economy between\n1984 and 2017, with nearly a quarter of that value, exceeding $300 billion, delivered in the last year of their analysis. Applying the average 2015-2017 growth\nrate from the NIST RTI analysis implies that the 2021 domestic value provided by GPS was approximately $700 billion and the 2023 value is expected to be\napproximately $1.1 trillion. This is consistent with analysis performed by the European Commission, which estimated the contribution of global navigation\nsatellite services (\u201cGNSS\u201d) in the European Union was approximately EUR 1.2 trillion in 2018.\nGPS and GNSS services have inherent limitations due to their faint signal and the geometry of the orbital satellites especially near the Earth\u2019s surface.\nThis results in poor performance, especially in urban environments, indoors, and other locations where precise altitude determination is essential. The\nincreasing demand for location services has resulted in the development of a number of supplements and alternatives to traditional GPS.\nNextNav Market Opportunity\nWe believe that the market opportunity for our services is significant, with a total addressable market of over $50 billion in the United States and over\n$100 billion globally. Nearly every segment of the global economy relies on geolocation or high-precision timing, directly or indirectly, and in general those\nservices are either: (a) expensive; (b) of limited performance; or (c) are derived only from GPS or global navigation satellite system (\u201cGNSS\u201d), and suffer from\nthe limitations and vulnerabilities of those services.\nWe have divided the broad application of our services into five major verticals:\n1) mission critical public safety and E911;\n2) mass market, mobile apps, and data analytics;\n3) eVTOLs, UAVs and autonomous vehicles;\n4) IOT critical infrastructure and resilient PNT; and\n5) global expansion.\nMission Critical Public Safety and E911\nOur solutions provide valuable services in the public safety market. Our Pinnacle service is currently being used by first responders enabling them to\nmore accurately locate a user with our 3D location services. The launch of our service for E911 callers with Verizon provides more accurate information to first\nresponders about callers\u2019 locations during a wireless 911 call. When TerraPoiNT becomes broadly available, it is expected to provide significant additional\nvalue to first responders.\nBased on information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the National Fire Protection Agency, we believe there are approximately 10 million primary\nfirst responders, extended primary first responders and non-military federal employees addressable by FirstNet\u00ae. We believe that these potential customers\nrepresent a total addressable market of approximately $",

We believe that these potential customers\nrepresent a total addressable market of approximately $1.2 billion.\nAccording to the National Emergency Number Association (NENA), E911, which is a FCC required service provided by telecommunications carriers to\ntheir subscribers, is dialed approximately 240 million times each year as citizens seek to summon aid for emergencies, including medical emergencies, fires and\nother incidents. Because FCC rules require E911 services to convey the caller\u2019s telephone number and detailed location information to emergency responders,\ngeolocation is an essential element of emergency response. Currently wireless customers pay through their wireless carrier approximately $0.70 per month,\ndepending on the jurisdiction in which they reside, into state and local E911 pools. A vast majority of those fees collected are directed towards E911 call center\nequipment. Based on a state-by-state review of E911 and other regulatory fees collected by wireless carriers we estimate a total addressable market for E911\nlocation services in the United States of approximately $2.3 billion.\nThe FCC\u2019s rules require wireless carriers to provide altitude information along with horizontal location information with E911 calls in urban markets,\nwith this requirement expanding to a nationwide basis in 2025. We have the opportunity to sell our services to wireless carriers to satisfy their regulatory\nobligations, improve the safety of their customers, and offer certain related services to Public Safety Answering Points to enhance the usability of E911 location\nservices directly and in partnership with other service providers.\nMass Market, Mobile Apps, and Data Analytics\nThe mobile app economy relies on the availability of location data for direct services to consumers, emerging augmented reality applications and for\nadvertising, marketing and analytics-driven monetization. Mobile advertising in the United States alone is projected by eMarketer to reach nearly $257 billion\nby 2026, from approximately $170 billion in 2022, and according to customer discussions approximately 40% of ad inventory is location-enabled.\n4",

According to Google, one-third, or\napproximately 1 million out of 3 million, apps on the Google Play Store use location. In 2019, nearly $1 billion was spent in app stores on approximately\n10,000 applications hosting at least one direct location services software development kit (\u201cSDK\u201d) (e.g., a mapping SDK and SDKs to enhance user experiences\nin venues), a small subset of the total apps using location, according to Apptopia data.\nMobile gaming also increasingly relies on location. One example is Niantic\u2019s Pokemon Go\u2122, the location-based game that captured national attention in\n2016 and continues to be the leading mobile game by revenue. Pokemon Go\u2122 generated over $3 billion in revenue between 2016 and 2019 according to\nSensorTower research. According to Statista research, this augmented reality trend is expected to accelerate, from approximately 10% of mobile gaming\nrevenue in 2020 to 75% in 2025, or approximately $7.5 billion in annual spend on augmented reality titles.\nAggregated data gathered from mass-market applications is also utilized for analytics, including foot-traffic and related analysis. Based on customer\ninteractions and internal analysis, we believe that the total addressable market value of location-enabled analytics data and reports exceeds $6 billion.\nFinally, mCommerce in the U.S. is expected to reach nearly $700 billion in 2025 according to eMarketer, growing at a compound annual growth rate\n(\u201cCAGR\u201d) of approximately 16% and is expected to result in significant online-to-offline and related opportunities.\nCollectively, we believe that the total addressable market for the mass-market segment in the United States is approximately $24 billion, and is\ncharacterized by multiple high-growth sectors.\neVTOLs, UAVs and Autonomous Vehicles\neVTOLs, UAVs and autonomous vehicles require reliable, accurate location data for navigation and timing services for control system synchronization.\nBased on discussions with potential customers, including leading urban air mobility (\u201cUAM\u201d) providers, we believe that our Pinnacle service will provide\na superior altitude or pressure reference both to airframe, autopilot and autonomous systems providers, and to air traffic control and air data providers.

The number of devices in these areas is expected to grow at a CAGR of nearly 70% between 2020 and 2026, while addressable service revenue is\nexpected to grow at a CAGR of 53% over the same period.\nWe also believe that there is a significant market for our services on a private network basis, at ex-urban college campuses and industrial facilities. We\nbelieve the total addressable market in enterprise and IOT in the United States is over $10 billion per year and growing rapidly.\nGPS plays an outsized role in the U.S. economy and our critical infrastructure, including communications networks and power grids, require a reliable\nGPS signal for accurate timing.

    "text": "Our Solutions\nOur location systems have been engineered and deployed to provide comprehensive solutions to the limitations and vulnerabilities inherent in GPS-based\nservices. Key GPS limitations include:\n\u25cf Low signal strength resulting in poor building/indoor penetration, limitations in urban areas;\n\u25cf Vulnerability to jamming;\n\u25cf Poor vertical accuracy in most devices, which impacts any service where altitude is relevant (e.g., multi-level structures, vertical separation in\nlow-altitude aviation);\n\u25cf The primary consumer GPS signal is unencrypted, resulting in poor location security and spoofing;\n\u25cf Inherent physical vulnerability due to few, isolated transmitters; and\n\u25cf Single point of failure for a wide range of PNT services.\nIsolated solutions to various aspects of the limitations to GPS-based positioning have been deployed, but none carry the primary benefit of GPS, which is\nhigh performance across a wide area.\nOur current service platforms include Pinnacle, our altitude (z-axis) solution, and TerraPoiNT, which is similar to a terrestrial GPS constellation. Both\nsystems offer metro-wide service, are inherently secure and can provide universal service access to all types of appropriately-equipped devices that use location\nservices.\nPinnacle\nPinnacle is our z-axis service, a dedicated vertical positioning network to cover entire metropolitan areas. Pinnacle provides devices equipped with a\nbarometric pressure sensor with the highest quality wide-area altitude service available in the U.S. market today based on a CTIA/FCC \u201c911 Location Test Bed,\nLLC Report on Stage Z\u201d from 2018. Our service is now available in the top 105 major U.S. markets, which include over 4,400 cities and over 90% of\ncommercial buildings that exceed three stories. In November 2022, Pinnacle service was launched by MetCom in Japan, and we anticipate MetCom will expand\ntheir service area in 2023.\nThe Pinnacle service is based three primary components:\n1) An altitude station network, a managed network that consists of equipment designed, manufactured, deployed and operated by us, which\nmeasures key environmental variables associated with altitude to enable \u201cfloor level\u201d altitude determination;\n2) Device software, which supports delivery of our z-axis service to mobile apps and other devices, calibration of the pressure sensors on individual\ndevices and receipt of z-axis data from our cloud services platform; and\n3) A secure cloud services platform, which actively manages our altitude station network, synthesizes data from our network and devices to enable\nservice delivery, and performs access management functions.\nThe diagram below illustrates the basic process flow of the z-axis service.\n7",

    "text": "Pinnacle works by leveraging the physical principal that barometric pressure declines as altitude increases. By measuring the barometric pressure at a\ndevice, and comparing that measurement to the measurements from our network, we can accurately compute the altitude of the sensor. A Pinnacle altitude\nstation is depicted below, and measures approximately 16\u201d x 6\u201d x 4\u201d.\nBecause our Pinnacle technology relies on barometric pressure measurement, it works with the hardware currently used in most mobile phones and\ntablets. Our Pinnacle service can be delivered to customers in this segment over an applications programming interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) or via an SDK integrated into\nthe relevant applications.\nIn order to expand access to and use of our Pinnacle services, we work closely with sensor vendors to provide input on key sensor performance factors\nnecessary to produce optimal Pinnacle services. We also recently launched the NextNav Certified\u2122 program. The NextNav Certified\u2122 program allows\npressure sensor vendors to perform a set of tests monitored by us. If a vendor meets the criteria for performance while adhering to the test procedures, the\nvendor can display the NextNav badge on its website and use the endorsement in its marketing to device vendors. Bosch Sensortec, InvenSense Goertek and ST\nMicroelectronics currently offer NextNav Certified\u2122 sensors.\nTerraPoiNT\nTerraPoiNT is our full 3D PNT system, standardized in the global telecommunications standards group, 3GPP Release 13 as Metropolitan Beacon System\n(\u201cMBS\u201d). The current technical specification for the standard MBS signal, or Interface Control Document, can be downloaded from ATIS, the North American\naffiliate to 3GPP. We are in the process of evolving our transmission and this technical specification, subject to the successful integration of technologies\nacquired from Nestwave. We license elements of our receiver technology to third-party chipset providers and device vendors, typically with no per device\nroyalty, to enable the reception of our signal on their devices.\nPositioning, navigation and timing are the core services provided by GPS, and TerraPoiNT can be thought of as a land-based GPS satellite constellation,\nbut with the broadcast transmitters, which we call \u201cbeacons.\u201d In the United States, this service operates on 8 MHz of contiguous LMS spectrum licensed to us\nin the 900 MHz band, and covering approximately 93% of the U.S. population (see \u201cRadio Spectrum\u201d for more information about these licenses). We have\ndeployed a wide area, commercial grade TerraPoiNT network in 2 markets in the San Francisco Bay Area and in smaller networks in 83 additional markets\nthroughout the U.S. We are also conducting a pilot program with our joint venture partner MetCom in Japan to support a possible spectrum allocation.\n8",

The beacon network is also synchronized to Coordinated Universal Time, the global time standard broadcast by GPS and other NIST-\ntraceable sources.\nThis architecture is naturally resilient to service disruption and significantly more resistant to jamming than GPS. If GPS is disrupted, or completely\neliminated, a TerraPoiNT transmitter continues to operate and provide similar service within the TerraPoiNT service area. If one TerraPoiNT beacon is\ndisrupted, service continues from other nearby beacons. Thus, there is both local and national resilience embedded in the basic system design. By operating\nterrestrially in the 900 MHz LMS band, the TerraPoiNT signal is approximately 100,000 times stronger than GPS, and thus is significantly more difficult to\ndisrupt.\n9",

    "text": "TerraPoiNT was initially designed for maximum compatibility with GPS and other GNSS receivers, previously demonstrated by Broadcom on a version\nof their 4775 platform and GCT\u2019s GDM7243i. We expect TerraPoiNT's signal waveform to evolve to be compatible with standard LTE/5G receivers. This\nevolution will enable the TerraPoiNT signal to be processed by the hardware used to process LTE and 5G signals. Separately, hybrid operation of our system\nwill allow us to rely in part on third party cellular signals that have been calibrated by our network. We anticipate that such a signal evolution would increase\nour spectral efficiency significantly, allowing us to offer a data capacity equivalent to other LTE/5G signals for the same bandwidth. This increased data\ntransmission capacity could be used, subject to FCC approval, to provide other types of LTE/5G-based two-way voice and data transmission services while\nmaintaining our PNT capabilities.\nThe expansion of the TerraPoiNT network build-out will require significant investment, however, compared to prior estimates, we believe that the hybrid\noperation of our network will require significantly less capital than that required by our historical network architecture. Once it is fully built-out, we expect to\nincur minimal ongoing maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the network. As a result, our business model provides significant operating leverage as the\nbusiness scales due to low variable costs to adding incremental network traffic.\nPrivacy and Data Security\nWe understand that protection of data and privacy is critically important to the end-users of our services. Our core privacy principles are:\n1. Transparency: We are transparent about our data practices, and we comply with our privacy policies and agreements so customers and business\npartners can make informed decisions.\n2. Control: We have implemented appropriate means for our customers and business partners to control relevant personal and business information.\n3. Security: We endeavor to protect the data entrusted to us by using strong security protocols.\n4. Compliance: We respect and comply with local privacy laws, ensuring that privacy-by-design is a core consideration as we develop our products\nand services.\n5. Consent: We require appropriate opt-in consent for the provision of all of our services, consistent with the requirements of local law.\nBased on industry best-practices, we have implemented multilayered administrative, physical, and technical security measures to protect data. Data access\nis implemented with the rule of \u201cleast privilege,\u201d and we isolate data by service, business function and customer agreement.

The parties also entered into escrow\narrangements on customary terms for intellectual property storage and verification of the deposited escrow materials in various different escrow \u201clockers,\u201d\nwhich could be accessed by AT&T based on different conditions on which the draw down could be made.\nIn 2019, we entered into an equipment hosting agreement with AT&T that has a seven-year term (subject to earlier termination after three years in certain\ncircumstances), expiring in October 2026. Under the terms of the equipment hosting agreement, AT&T is providing all site related services during AT&T\u2019s\ncontinued use of the service. However, if AT&T ceases to use our services after the first three years (i.e. October 2022), then we may terminate the equipment\nhosting agreement or if we are not in breach of the agreement we may continue the agreement for the remainder of the term and we will have to pay for power\nand, LTE connectivity and incremental lease costs incurred by AT&T to host the equipment, if any. Our services agreement with AT&T for distribution of our\nservices to FirstNet\u00ae customers, which was scheduled to expire in October 2022, has been extended to January 7, 2024.\nCompetition and Competitive Advantages\nThe geolocation industry is highly competitive and we compete with incumbent geolocation services like GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular signals, augmented by\nother sensor inputs, as well as other companies who are new entrants into the market seeking to provide a solution to the same needs as we are.\nThe increasing demand for location services has resulted in the development of a number of supplements and alternatives to traditional GPS. The primary\ncandidates for GPS backup technologies are based on approaches that are significantly different than the technical approach adopted by us. These competitive\ntechnologies include:\n\u25cf eLORAN. eLORAN is an advanced version of the World War II-era hyperbolic radio navigation system that was developed in response to the\nperceived vulnerability of the GNSS systems. eLORAN, like its predecessor uses very low frequencies (in the 100 kHz range), but has an advanced\nreceiver design and transmission characteristics, which increase the accuracy and usefulness of traditional LORAN. These enhancements make it a\nsuitable substitute for GPS. Because eLORAN requires larger antennas and form factor for its receivers, it does not have the same reach as our\nsolutions. It is more suitable for more rural and maritime types of environment.\n\u25cf LEO Satellite Systems. Low Earth orbit (\u201cLEO\u201d) satellite systems offer primarily timing service based on signals transmitted from low earth orbit\nsatellite constellations, transmitted in the L-Band.

Because it is in a lower orbit, the LEO signal is much stronger than GPS, allowing for improved\nreception in urban areas and limited indoor reception. The primary limitation of LEO-based systems is that they remain a satellite-based signal, so\nthe signal is not as strong as a terrestrial-based system. In addition, as an add-on technology, its design is not as flexible as a dedicated system.\n\u25cf Commercial Location Systems. Commercial location systems generally include cellular systems, crowd-sourced systems and locally managed\nsystems. Cellular systems may use localized millimeter wave transmitters in 5G which provides location performance in the immediate vicinity of\nsuch 5G transmitters, but the service area of this capability, if deployed, is expected to be limited. Cellular systems are typically used as a fallback\nwhen the GPS signal is not available (e.g., indoors), but do not provide the same accuracy that our solutions provide and are ultimately dependent\non GPS. Crowd-sourced systems, such as those provided by Google and Apple through APIs in their mobile operation system platforms, rely on the\napplication of machine learning techniques to location information gathered from mobile devices. These systems are \u201cbest-efforts systems\u201d that\ncompare GPS measurements to Wi-Fi access point signal strength, cellular signals and other signals gathered from millions of devices to estimate\nthe location of the access points. Crowd-sourced systems vary considerably in accuracy, offer less accurate vertical positioning information and are\nsubject to degradation if there is an issue with local power and local access points. Locally Managed Systems are systems that rely on the\nmanagement of lower-power signals, managed WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy, dedicated beacons with large bandwidth requirements and\nUltrawideband to provide location services. These systems are centrally managed by the enterprise or a vendor, and typically offer high accuracy\nand reliability, but are expensive to deploy and manage, offer only limited coverage, are dependent upon local power sources and are usually only\navailable to the entity that deployed them. Most commercial locations systems do not provide an independent timing source, so are limited in their\nability to be a viable backup to GPS.\nWe believe our 3D solutions offer a superior alternative to each of these services.

We hold radio licenses issued by the FCC that authorize the use of 8 MHz of contiguous\nspectrum in the 900 MHz band covering approximately 93% of the population in the United States. These licenses and the FCC rules impose obligations on us\nregarding the use of this spectrum, including power and operational limits, spectrum sharing and interference restrictions, build out and usage requirements, and\na license renewal obligation. We must comply with these requirements in order to retain access and use of its spectrum resources.\nPrivacy\nIn developing highly accurate location information, we collect, process, transmit and store personal information, such as certain individual geolocation\ninformation, and other personal information relating to its business contacts, personnel, end users, and website visitors. A variety of federal and state laws and\nregulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of this information. The U.S. privacy and data protection legal landscape continues to\nevolve, with California and Virginia having enacted broad-based data privacy and protection legislation and with states and the federal government continuing\nto consider additional data privacy and protection legislation. As we expand overseas, our joint venture partners will be subject to foreign data privacy and\nprotection legislation, and we may be as well.\n14",

You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other\ninformation included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before you decide whether to invest in our securities. We may face additional risks and uncertainties\nthat are not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, which may also impair our business. The following discussion should be read in\nconnection with the financial statements and notes to the financial statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should consult\nyour own financial and legal advisors as to the risks entailed by an investment in our securities and the suitability of investing in our securities in light of your\nparticular circumstances. Some statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including such statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-\nlooking statements. See the section entitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to the Business and the Industry\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception. We expect to incur losses in the future, may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability, and may\nneed to raise additional capital to maintain our operations in the future.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception and until the second quarter of 2021 had not widely commercially sold our solutions. For the years\nended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we incurred net losses of $40.1 million, $144.7 million and $137.3 million, respectively. Furthermore, any\nexpansion of our TerraPoiNT services will result in increased operating costs. As a result, our losses are expected to continue and we may not achieve\nprofitability when expected, or at all. Even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability.\nSince becoming a public company, our operating expenses have increased, and we expect our operating expenses to continue to increase over the next\nseveral years as we scale our operations, increase research and development efforts relating to new offerings and technologies, hire more employees, and\noperate as a public company. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in meaningful revenue or growth in our business. Any failure\nto initiate and increase our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses could prevent us from achieving or maintaining\nprofitability or positive cash flow. If our future growth and operating performance fail to meet investor or analyst expectations, or if we have future negative\ncash flow or losses resulting from expanding our operations, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as of March 30, 2023 will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital\nexpenditure needs, including all contractual commitments, for the next 12 months. We expect to meet longer term expected future cash requirements and\nobligations through a combination of cash flows from operations and issuance of equity securities or debt offerings. However, this determination is based upon\ninternal projections of operating cash flows and is subject to changes in market and business conditions. Our ability to obtain debt financing and/or issue equity\nsecurities on acceptable terms, or at all, will depend on, among other things, our financial performance and credit ratings, general economic factors, including\n",

Further, because we have limited historical\nfinancial data and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we\nhad a longer operating history or operated in a more developed market. Forecasting the revenue potential of our services is made more difficult by the fact that\nlegacy location technologies, such as GPS, were developed by the federal government and made available to commercial users without charge. As a result, one\nof the adoption hurdles that must be overcome is convincing enterprise customers that the additional accuracy and security made available by our services\njustifies paying for them. We have encountered in the past, and we will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing\ncompanies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries.

This carries risks related to the technical performance of this\ntransmission. If the technical performance of the LTE/5G transmission is not similar to the technical performance of our legacy technologies, then the market\nfor our services may be diminished. Finally, while we intend our signal to be compatible with LTE/5G receivers, we may not be successful at integrating our\nservice into commercial LTE/5G receivers, which would significantly reduce the market for our services.\nOur hybrid architecture, which depends on the use of our transmitters and our ability to calibrate signals transmitted by third parties, is unproven, may not\nperform well and may cost significantly more than our initial estimates.\nWe are currently planning to provide our resilient PNT service through a \u201chybrid\u201d architecture that relies in part on our signal (whether compatible with\nGPS/GNSS or LTE/5G), and in part on signals radiated by cellular operators and other third parties that are calibrated by us. If we are not able to calibrate the\nsignals radiated by cellular operators and other third parties, then the performance of our hybrid system may not be sufficient to meet customer requirements,\nand the market for our services may be diminished. Our hybrid architecture may also not result in the cost savings estimated by us, which would substantially\nincrease our future capital and operating expenditures.\nWe face intense competition in our market, especially from competitors that offer their location services for free, which could make it difficult for us to\nacquire and retain customers and end users.\nThe market for development, distribution and sale of location services is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have strong name recognition,\nsizable customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, public relations, sales, distribution and other resources than we do. These\ncompetitors often offer competing services for free and have the financial capabilities to continue to improve upon their location services offering without\ncharging a fee. Certain of our competitors are already vying for market share in the 3D location space through their participation in a federal regulatory\nproceeding involving the FCC in which wireless carriers are being required to enter into relationships with 3D location vendors in order to enable accurate 3D\nlocation information to be conveyed to E911 emergency dispatchers with each wireless call made to E911 emergency services. In June of 2022, the CTIA, a\ntrade association representing the wireless communications industry in the United States, filed a statement with the FCC that solutions provided by these\ncompetitors meet these FCC requirements. If the FCC accepts this statement, then the market for our services for E911 may be reduced.

The\nperformance of our services may vary based on ambient conditions, both physical and environmental which may impact the timing and location accuracy of the\nsystem. If our services are not meaningfully superior to those available at lower or no cost, we may have difficulty selling our services, achieving widespread\nadoption of our services and our business, financial position and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe face competition from multiple sources.\nOur services compete against: (i) other satellite and terrestrial based location technology offerings, such as GPS, Observed Time Difference of Arrival and\nterrestrial beacons; (ii) other providers of WiFi and cell-based positioning, such as Google, Apple, Polaris and Skyhook; (iii) venue-based solutions such as\nBluetooth Low Energy; and (iv) other in-house developed location solutions. In the smartphone location provider market, because Apple and Google control a\nlarge percentage of the market share for smartphone operating systems, already provide their services on a nationwide basis, and both offer location provider\nservices free as part of the iOS and Android markets, we are constrained in the distribution and monetization of our services in that market. As noted above,\nthose vendors that secure access to wireless handsets for their 3D location services may be able to leverage a significant competitive advantage over other\nlocation service vendors. There are also a number of new location technologies in development that may further increase competition to support location\ncapabilities in various wireless devices (such as Internet of Things) and which may require us to meet more stringent accuracy standards.\nCertain of our competitors are substantially larger than us and have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources. Thus, many of these large\nenterprises are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in spending by customers in its markets, and often have broader product lines and\nmarket focus, have greater brand recognition and may not be as susceptible to downturns in a single market.

    "text": "Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nOur business depends on access to radio spectrum to provide certain of our location services and access to such spectrum on a nationwide basis is not a\ncertainty.\nCertain of our location services depend on our ability to use portions of the radio spectrum licensed by the FCC. Through our wholly owned affiliate,\nProgeny LMS, LLC, we hold licenses issued by the FCC to use radio spectrum for location services within the 902-928 MHz band, identified by the FCC as\nLMS licenses. Our LMS licenses provide coverage of most areas of the U.S. and the vast majority of populated areas within the U.S. Our licenses, however, do\nnot provide nationwide coverage, which we are likely to need to provide certain of our location services on a nationwide basis. Most of the geographic areas\nwhere we lack spectrum are generally rural in character, although we do not hold licensed spectrum assets in two well populated locations, Minneapolis and\nSacramento. Therefore, we may need to secure additional spectrum licenses from the FCC or other LMS license holders for additional frequencies within the\n902-928 MHz band or in other frequencies in order to achieve nationwide coverage or to serve every major city. Radio spectrum is a scarce public resource and\nno certainty exists that we will be able to obtain additional licenses to provide nationwide coverage or obtain them at a reasonable cost. Very few private entities\nhold LMS licenses that we could acquire in a private transaction. Although the FCC regularly issues new spectrum licenses, the FCC has not issued new LMS\nlicenses for spectrum within the 902-928 MHz band since 2001 and it could decide to refrain from issuing any additional LMS licenses because the 902-928\nMHz frequencies are also used by other services on a shared basis, including by certain unlicensed devices used in homes and for such enterprise services as\nutility meter reading. If the FCC does issue additional LMS licenses, the FCC is likely to distribute those licenses through an auction process, requiring us to\nparticipate and compete with other bidders in such an auction, with no certainty of winning. If we are unable to secure additional LMS licenses or suitable\nalternative spectrum in a different frequency band, our ability to expand certain of our services nationwide may be negatively impacted, which may have a\nnegative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently do not hold any rights to use licensed spectrum resources outside the U.S. The rules for securing access to spectrum rights vary in each\ncountry. Further, different portions of the radio frequency band, including the 902-928 MHz band, are used for different purposes in different countries and\nregions. Therefore, no certainty exists that suitable spectrum resources can be identified or secured in international locations where we would seek to expand\nour business. In those countries where suitable spectrum resources may be available, spectrum licenses are often distributed through an auction or tender\nprocess, meaning we would have to compete with other applicants for access to spectrum rights, the success of which cannot be assured.\nEven if we are able to convert our signal transmissions to an LTE/5G wave form, the FCC may not permit us to realize all of the benefits of our hybrid\nLTE/5G architecture, including the transmission of high-throughput non-PNT-related voice and data.\nOne of the significant benefits of converting our spectrum transmissions to an LTE/5G waveform would be a substantial increase in the",

The FCC\u2019s rules already permit us to use our 8 MHz\nof LMS spectrum for the carriage of two-way voice and data services, but these communications must be related to our PNT services and must be transmitted\nprimarily to and from vehicles and the occupants of those vehicles. Further, the voice and data communications are not permitted to be interconnected in real\ntime with the public switched network unless a store and forward technology is used. Therefore, to maximize the benefit of a conversion to an LTE/5G\nwaveform, assuming the conversion is successful, we will need to request flexibility from the FCC permitting us to use our spectrum for additional non-PNT-\nrelated services in addition to our PNT offerings. This approval could include the removal of the restrictions on the types of two-way voice and data\ntransmissions provided using the network, the types of end user devices that primarily send and receive the two-way voice and data communications, and the\nability to interconnect in real time with the public switched network. Any such proposal could face substantial opposition from our competitors and other users\nof the 902-928 MHz band, and there is no certainty that the FCC will provide us this flexibility or the extent of the flexibility that is provided.\nOur FCC licenses authorize the use of radio frequencies that are shared with other radio services, which could result in harmful interference and\nimpairment to our use of our licensed spectrum.\nOur LMS licenses authorize us to use the upper portion of the 902-928 MHz band. This spectrum is a shared frequency band that is used for a number of\npurposes both by individuals, businesses and the federal government. Other services that are authorized to use these frequencies include federal radiolocation\nsystems; industrial, scientific and medical devices; licensed amateur radio operations; and certain unlicensed devices. Our use of the spectrum is subject to FCC\nrequirements that our operations must accept harmful interference from other uses of the spectrum that have more senior rights to the spectrum. We have been\nsuccessful thus far in using our LMS spectrum to operate location services without experiencing material impairment of our location services caused by more\nsenior spectrum uses, but no certainty exists that we will be able to continue to do so. Moreover, for certain specialized uses, including non-PNT-related two-\nway voice and data uses, the use of our spectrum would be subject to additional regulatory review, approvals and/or limitations. More senior uses of the 902-\n928 MHz band could become more numerous or could alter the characteristics of their transmissions in ways that could increase the interference to our location\nservices, resulting",

Third-party challenges to the FCC decision, are still pending. Further, changes in our operations could alter the\ntransmission characteristics of its location services, potentially requiring us to provide further demonstrations that our location services do not cause\nunacceptable levels of harmful interference to those unlicensed devices.

The\nFCC\u2019s rules do not identify a specific threshold that must be demonstrated in order for us to secure renewal of our LMS licenses, which means the applicable\nthreshold is the FCC\u2019s statutory obligation to grant a renewal of our licenses if it serves the public interest. Our LMS licenses were initially required to be\nrenewed on July 19, 2010. We timely filed an application for renewal, which the FCC granted on January 17, 2017. The FCC\u2019s renewal grant was expressly\nconditioned on our compliance with build-out requirements, discussed further below. On July 7, 2020, we filed a second request for renewal of our LMS\nlicenses, which is still pending before the FCC. If we secure the renewal of our LMS licenses, our license renewal applications thereafter will be subject to new\nFCC rules placing additional conditions on license renewal applications. Specifically, in order to secure a third renewal of our LMS licenses in 2030, we will be\nrequired to demonstrate compliance with additional requirements, including that we have satisfied its build-out construction requirements, that we use our\nnetwork to provide service to the public, and that the service provided is at least at the same level of service that was demonstrated at the time of our build-out\nshowing. No certainty exists that we will receive the currently applied for renewal or continue to meet the requirements of such renewal for future applications.\nIf we fail to secure renewals for our LMS licenses, we will not be able to pursue our TerraPoiNT services as previously planned and our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur LMS licenses are subject to end-of-term build-out requirements maintained by the FCC and no certainty exists that we will be able to comply with the\nbuild out requirements and retain our licenses.\nOur LMS licenses are subject to FCC rules that require licensees to make productive use of their licensed radio spectrum by a specific deadline and\ncontinue such use throughout the term of the licenses. If a licensee fails to satisfy one of its build-out deadlines, the FCC will declare its licenses to be null and\nvoid. Over the years, the FCC has revoked many of the LMS licenses that the FCC issued to other parties for failing to satisfy their build-out requirements. In\nnearly all instances in which our licenses have reached a deadline to demonstrate the build-out and use of the licensed spectrum, we have either secured a\nfavorable ruling from the FCC regarding the sufficiency of our build-out showing, or a waiver or extension of our build-out requirements.

The October 3, 2020 deadline identified above had been set for April 3, 2020, but we filed a request for a six month extension of the\ndeadline as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which the FCC granted on July 19, 2020, extending our deadline to October 3, 2020. Based on the ongoing\nnature of the pandemic, on September 17, 2020, we filed a request for a second six month extension of the build-out deadline, which was granted by the FCC on\nMarch 29, 2023, extending our build-out deadline until April 3, 2021. The FCC also further extended our build-out deadline until June 17, 2021 to cover an\namended build-out notification that the FCC staff asked us to submit by that date.\nTo comply with our build-out requirements on each of the deadlines, we must demonstrate for each of our LMS licenses either that the geographic area of\nour licensed network provides coverage of at least two-thirds of the population in each of the licensed areas or that we are providing substantial service to end\nusers in each of our licensed areas. On February 2, 2021, we filed a waiver request with the FCC seeking approval to use a third option, demonstrating that the\ngeographic area of our licensed network provides coverage of at least two-thirds of relatively tall buildings (those in excess of three stories) rather than two-\nthirds of the population. We employed our proposed tall building coverage approach with respect to the end-of-term build-out showings that we filed with the\nFCC for our 82 LMS licenses that were subject to an April 3, 2021 end-of-term building out deadline. On March 29, 2023, the FCC issued an order concluding\nthat the use of a network construction approach involving coverage of relative tall buildings, rather than population, is warranted in this situation. The order\ndirected the FCC staff to apply this finding to its review of the construction notifications that we filed for each of our LMS licenses.

As a result, our retention and use of our LMS licenses has been the subject\nof comments and objections from third parties, including other users of the 902-928 MHz frequencies and other current and former licensees of LMS spectrum.\nIn the past, the FCC has regularly rejected and dismissed these objections to our retention and use of our LMS licenses, but no certainty exists that the FCC will\ncontinue to do so in the future. Certain of the previous objections remain pending before the FCC, meaning that the FCC could still act on them in a manner that\nis adverse to us.

In addition, several affiliated companies\ncontrolled by a former licensee of LMS spectrum have filed numerous objections and adverse pleadings against our LMS licenses. A number of these adverse\npleadings remain pending, including a petition, dated February 3, 2021, requesting the FCC to reallocate the 902-928 MHz band for other purposes. Although\nthe FCC has consistently rejected the adverse pleadings that were filed by this individual in the past, no certainty exists that the FCC will continue to do so.

The extensive and changing nature of these export control laws and related licensing\npolicies may diminish our ability to market our solutions in the certain markets.\nWe are exposed to risks related to geopolitical and economic factors, laws and regulations and our international business subjects us to numerous political\nand economic factors, legal requirements, cross-cultural considerations and other risks associated with doing business globally.\nAlthough our international business is still in its early stages, its development is subject to both U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without\nlimitation, laws and regulations relating to export/import controls (described above), sanctions, technology transfer restrictions, government contracts and\nprocurement, data privacy and protection, anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act, security\nrestrictions and intellectual property. Failure by us, our employees, affiliates, partners or others with whom we work to comply with applicable laws and\nregulations could result in administrative, civil, commercial or criminal liabilities, including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension\nof our export/import privileges. New regulations and requirements, or changes to existing ones in the various countries in which we operate can significantly\nincrease our costs and risks of doing business internationally.\nChanges in laws, regulations, political leadership and environment, and/or security risks may dramatically affect our ability to conduct or continue to\nconduct business in international markets, including sales to customers and purchases from suppliers outside the U.S. We may also be impacted by U.S. and\nforeign national policies and priorities, political decisions and geopolitical relationships, any of which may be influenced by changes in the threat environment,\npolitical leadership, geopolitical uncertainties, world events, bilateral and multi-lateral relationships and economic and political factors, and any of which could\nimpact our operations and/or export authorizations, or delay purchasing decisions or payments and the provision of supplies, goods and services.

    "text": "Overview\nWe are the market leader in delivering next generation PNT solutions that overcome the limitations of existing space-based GPS. The world increasingly\nrequires more accurate and resilient PNT capabilities. Public safety, autonomous vehicles, eVTOLs, UAVs, and the app economy all require precise 3D location\nsolutions. Paramedics need to know which apartment a 911 call originated from, ride hailing and delivery apps need to know precisely where you are standing\nand game developers need precise 3D location data to deliver a next generation augmented reality experience.\nIn early 2021, we launched the first element of our next generation GPS service through initial commercial launch of our nationwide Pinnacle network\nthat was deployed in partnership with AT&T Services, Inc. (\u201cAT&T\u201d). The Pinnacle network provides \u201cfloor-level\u201d altitude data to over 90% of commercial\nstructures over three stories in the U.S. Pinnacle is being utilized by FirstNet\u00ae for public safety. We are currently providing service to Verizon as a customer for\nE911 services, using our Pinnacle 911 solution. Pinnacle has also been adopted by a growing number of public safety apps, commercial apps and app\ndevelopment platforms, including Unity Engine, CRG, GeoComm, Rapid Deploy, Central Square, NGA 911, Qualcomm, and the Unreal Engine. We believe\nthat ramp up of customers using our existing Pinnacle network will support revenue growth over the coming year.\nWe will be extending our capabilities by expanding the deployment our TerraPoiNT system, which is a nationwide network that is designed to overcome\nthe inherent limitations of traditional GPS. TerraPoiNT utilizes a network of specialized wide area location transmitters that broadcast an encrypted PNT signal\non our licensed 900 MHz LMS spectrum with a signal that is 100,000 times stronger than GPS. TerraPoiNT is well suited for urban and indoor environments\nwhere existing GPS signals are either distorted or blocked all together. In addition, TerraPoiNT provides redundancy for GPS, which is vulnerable to spoofing\nand jamming. GPS redundancy is increasingly a U.S. national security priority and is a rising priority in the other parts of the world. Critical infrastructure,\nincluding communications networks and power grids, require a reliable GPS signal for accurate timing. A failure of GPS would be catastrophic, and there is no\nback-up today.\nSince the inception of NextNav, LLC in 2007, we have secured valuable FCC licenses covering approximately 93% of the U.S. population for a\ncontinuous 8 MHz band of 900 MHz spectrum, filed more than 150 patents related to our systems and services, deployed the nationwide Pinnacle network and\nlaunched commercial service.

While the impact of this supply constraint is not material to the Company's network projects at this time, we continue to carefully manage labor\nand materials supply matters. Additionally, the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nManagement continues to actively monitor our financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry and workforce. We expect these macroeconomic\nand COVID-19 factors and their effects on our operations to continue through the remainder of 2023.\nKey Components of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe have generated limited revenue since our inception. We derive our revenue from \u201cfloor-level\u201d altitude location data, and related products and services,\nand PNT products and services. Our revenue includes revenue generated through services contracts with wireless carriers, services with applications developers,\ntechnology demonstration, assessment and support contracts with government customers, sales of equipment, and licensing of proprietary technology. We\nrecognize revenue when an arrangement exists, services, equipment or access to licensed technology are delivered, the transaction price is determined, the\narrangement has commercial substance, and collection of consideration is probable.\nOperating Expense\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold (\u201cCOGS\u201d) consist of personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, and allocated facility\ncosts for our operations and manufacturing teams. COGS also includes expenses for site leases, cost of equipment, and professional services related to the\nmaintenance of the equipment at each leased site. We expect our operations costs to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in the expansion\nof our Pinnacle and TerraPoiNT networks in domestic U.S. and international markets.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses consist of personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, and allocated\nfacility costs for our research and development functions. Research and development costs also include outside professional services for software and hardware\ndevelopment, cloud hosting costs, and software licensing costs. We expect our research and development costs to increase for the foreseeable future as we\ncontinue to invest in research and development for our current products and future products.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of personnel-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, and\nallocated facility costs for our business development, marketing, corporate, executive, finance legal, human resources, IT and other administrative functions.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses also include expenses for outside professional services, including legal, auditing and accounting services,\nrecruitment expenses, travel expenses and certain non-income taxes, insurance and other administrative expenses.\nWe expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we scale headcount with the growth of our business,\nand as a result of operating as a public company, including compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, legal, audit, additional insurance expenses,\ninvestor relations activities, and other administrative and professional services. As a result, we expect our selling, general and administrative expenses will\nincrease in absolute dollars but may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue over time.\n37",

We have primarily relied upon debt and equity\nfinancings to fund our cash requirements.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we incurred net losses of $40.1 million and $144.7 million, respectively. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, our net cash used in operating activities and investing activities was $37.1 million and $15.7 million, respectively.

Our critical accounting estimates are those\nestimates that involve a significant level of uncertainty at the time the estimate was made, and changes in them have had or are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. We base our estimates\non past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis.\nSee Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of significant\naccounting policies and the effect on our financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue from indoor and dense-urban positioning technology, products and services including revenue generated through technology\ndemonstration and assessment contracts with customers, support services provided to customers, sales of equipment, and licensing of proprietary technology.\nWe recognize revenue when an arrangement exists, services, equipment or access to licensed technology are delivered, the transaction price is determined,\nthe arrangement has commercial substance, payment terms are determined and collection of consideration is probable.\nWe sell software licenses and services through arrangements that may bundle software, equipment, and other services. When we determine that we have\nseparate distinct performance obligations, we allocate the bundled contract price among the various performance obligations based on each deliverable\u2019s stand-\nalone selling price. If the stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, we estimate the amount to be allocated for each performance obligation based on\nobservable market transactions. When we determine the performance obligations are not distinct, we recognize revenue on a combined basis as the obligation is\nsatisfied. To the extent our contracts include variable consideration, the transaction price includes both fixed and variable consideration. The variable\nconsideration contained within our contracts with customers may include discounts, credits and other similar items. When a contract includes variable\nconsideration, we evaluate the estimate of the variable consideration to determine whether the estimate needs to be constrained; therefore, we include the\nvariable consideration",

Customers do not\nhave rights of return without our prior consent. Revenue pursuant to licensing agreements for our technology represents performance obligations that are\nsatisfied over time. We recognize support services ratably over the periods in which the services are provided; the related costs are expensed as incurred.\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, and deferred revenue on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. We bill amounts under our agreed-upon contractual terms at periodic intervals for services, upon shipment for equipment, or upon\nachievement of contractual milestones or as work progresses. Billing may occur subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in accounts receivable. We may\nalso receive payments from customers before revenue is recognized, resulting in deferred revenue.\nIndefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nWe hold wireless Multilateration LMS licenses. Certain general regulatory requirements apply to all licensed wireless spectrum, including, for example,\ncertain build-out or \u201csubstantial service\u201d requirements, which generally must be satisfied as a condition to the retention of the license. We are actively engaged\nin either meeting such requirements currently or seeking an extension of such requirements from the FCC for each of our LMS licenses. Although licenses are\nissued for only a fixed time, ten years, such licenses are subject to renewal by the FCC, based on the achievement of certain milestones and a finding that such\nrenewal would serve the public interest. Renewal of our licenses has occurred previously and at nominal cost. As a result, we treat our wireless LMS spectrum\nlicenses as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. We reevaluate the useful life determination for wireless licenses each year to determine whether events and\ncircumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. Costs incurred to maintain the FCC licenses are recorded in operating expenses.\nWe assess indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment annually as of October 1, or during the year if an event or other circumstance\nindicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. In evaluating indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we first assess\nqualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude that it is not\nmore likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value, then no further testing is required. However, if we conclude that it is more\nlikely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value, then we perform a two-step impairment test to identify potential impairment and\nmeasures the amount of impairment we will recognize, if any.\nLong-lived Assets\nOur property and equipment, network under construction, intangible assets and equity method investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events\nor changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for\npossible impairment, impairment is determined by comparing the carrying value of these long-lived assets to management\u2019s probability weighted estimate of\nthe future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets or asset group. In the event an impairment exists, a loss is recognized based on\nthe amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset group.\nGoodwill\nGood",

The Company operates as one reporting unit. When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company may first perform an optional qualitative\nassessment. If the Company determines it is not more likely than not the reporting unit\u2019s fair value is less than its carrying value, then no further analysis is\nnecessary. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative\nimpairment test will be performed. Under the quantitative impairment test, if the carrying amount of the Company\u2019s reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the\nCompany will recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess but limited to the total amount of goodwill.\nWarrants\nPrivate Placement Warrants are classified as non-current liabilities and reported at fair value at each reporting period. The fair value of the Private\nPlacement Warrants is accounted for using the Monte-Carlo simulation analysis. The Monte-Carlo simulation analysis requires us to make certain assumptions,\nincluding the expected volatility, the risk-free interest rate, and the dividend yield. The expected dividend rate of zero is based on the fact that we have not\nhistorically paid and do not expect to pay a dividend on our common stock. The risk free rate was based on U.S. Treasury yields for securities with similar\nterms. Volatility was calculated based on the trading prices for a group of comparable public companies.\n43",

We amortize the fair value of awards\nexpected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the period from the grant date to the end of the\nvesting period. The determination of the fair value of our stock option awards is based on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, our common stock\nprice, risk-free rate, expected stock price volatility over the expected life of awards, dividend yield and, award\u2019s expected term. The assumptions used to\ndetermine the fair value of the stock options represent management\u2019s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of\nmanagement\u2019s judgment. Additionally, we account for forfeitures for stock-based awards as they occur.\nIncome Taxes\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 740, \u201cIncome Taxes,\u201d deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax\nconsequences attributable to net operating losses, tax credits, and temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and\nliabilities and their respective tax bases, which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. Our income tax expense/benefit, deferred tax assets and\ntax receivable liability reflect management\u2019s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes. Significant judgments and estimates are required in\ndetermining the consolidated income tax expense/benefits, deferred tax assets and tax receivable agreement liability. In evaluating our ability to recover our\ndeferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including projected future taxable income and results of recent operations.\nEstimating future taxable income is inherently uncertain, requires judgment and is consistent with estimates we are using to manage our business. If we\ndetermine in the future that we will not be able to fully utilize all or part of the deferred tax assets, we would record a valuation allowance through earnings in\nthe period the determination was made.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Standards\nFor information regarding new accounting pronouncements, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, if any,\nrefer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nSection 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting\nstandards until private companies are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can\nchoose not to take advantage of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, and any such\nelection to not take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable. Spartacus previously elected to avail itself of the extended transition period, and\nfollowing the consummation of the Business Combination, we became an emerging growth company (for the period described in the immediately succeeding\nparagraph) and will continue to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period emerging growth company status permits.

During the extended\ntransition period, it may be difficult or impossible to compare our financial results with the financial results of another public company that complies with\npublic company effective dates for accounting standard updates because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act until the earliest of (a) December 31, 2025, (b) the last date of our fiscal year in which\nwe have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, (c) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d under the rules of the SEC or\n(d) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the previous three years.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had cash and cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities of $55.4 million as of December 31, 2022, which are held for working capital\npurposes. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and investments in marketable securities, which consisted of\nmoney market funds and U.S. Government Agency Bonds. The fair values of our investments in U.S. Government Agency Bonds will generally fluctuate with\nmovements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. Due to the short-term\nnature of these instruments, we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value due to changes in interest rates. The effect of a\nhypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n44",

In addition, we seek to minimize our exposure to banking risk by limiting the amount of uninsured deposits and investing our excess cash in U.S.\ngovernment and government agency bonds, and money market funds.\nEffects of Inflation and Supply Chain\nWhile inflation and supply chain challenges may impact our revenue and cost of services, we believe the effects of inflation and supply chain challenges\non our results of operations and financial condition have not been significant to date.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period\nended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nAdoption of ASU No. 2016-02\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases in 2022 due to the adoption of\nAccounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and the related amendments.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and\nare required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor\nwere we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\nAccordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating\nthe overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2012.\nTysons, Virginia\nMarch 30, 2023\nF-2",

During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred net losses of $40.1 million and\n$144.7 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $37.1 million and $47.9 million,\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was $55.4 million and no third-party debt was outstanding. The\nCompany\u2019s primary use of cash is to fund operations as NextNav continues to grow. The Company expects to incur additional losses and higher operating\nexpenses for the foreseeable future, specifically as NextNav invests in ongoing research and development and the expansion of the TerraPoiNT network.\nManagement has the intent and ability to manage liquidity through the timing and extent of research and development spend, as well as other discretionary\noperating expenses. The Company believes that its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as of March 30, 2023, will be sufficient to meet its\nworking capital and capital expenditure needs, including all contractual commitments, for the next 12 months. The Company expects to meet longer term\nexpected future cash requirements and obligations through a combination of cash flows from operations and issuance of equity securities or debt offerings.\nHowever, this determination is based upon internal projections of operating cash flows and is subject to changes in market and business conditions. The\nCompany\u2019s ability to obtain debt financing and/or issue equity securities on acceptable terms, or at all, will depend on, among other things, its financial\nperformance and credit ratings, general economic factors, including inflation and then-current interest rates, the condition of the credit and capital markets and\nother events, some of which may be beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nOn October 28, 2021, the Company consummated a business combination pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 9,\n2021, by and among the Company, Spartacus Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation (\u201cSpartacus\u201d), NextNav Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited\nliability company (\u201cHoldings\u201d) and the other parties thereto (the \u201cBusiness Combination\u201d).

Accordingly, the reverse recapitalization was treated as the\nequivalent of Holdings issuing stock for the net assets of Spartacus, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Spartacus are stated at historical costs,\nwith no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. All intercompany transactions have been\neliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period and\naccompanying notes. These estimates include those related to the useful lives and recoverability of long-lived and intangible assets (including goodwill),\nvaluation of common stock warrants, income taxes and equity-based compensation, among others. NextNav bases estimates on historical experience,\nanticipated results and various other assumptions, including assumptions of future events, it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of\nwhich form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expenses, that are not readily apparent from other\nsources. Actual results and outcomes could differ materially from these estimates and assumptions.\nF-7",

    "text": "NEXTNAV INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nCash and cash equivalents include all cash in banks and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased. The\ncombined account balances held on deposit at each institution typically exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) insurance coverage and, as a\nresult, there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage. The Company seeks to reduce this risk by\nmaintaining such deposits with high quality financial institutions that management believes are creditworthy. Further, the Company seeks to minimize its\nexposure to banking risk by limiting the amount of uninsured deposits and investing its excess cash in U.S. government and government agency bonds, and\nmoney market funds.\nThe Company invests excess cash primarily in U.S. government and government agency bonds, and money market funds. The Company classifies all\nmarketable securities that have stated maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents, and those that have stated maturities of\nover three months as short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company determines the appropriate classification of investments in\nmarketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation at each balance sheet date. The Company\u2019s marketable securities are classified as\ntrading and are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses, including unrealized, recognized in interest income (expense).\nEquity Method Investment\nThe Company reports its investments in unconsolidated entities, over whose operating and financial policies the Company has the ability to exercise\nsignificant influence, but not control, under the equity method of accounting. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment\nincludes considering key factors such as ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material\nintercompany transactions.\nThe initial carrying value of equity method investment is based on the amount paid to purchase the interest in the investee entity. Subsequently, the\ninvestment is increased or decreased by the Company\u2019s proportionate share in the investee\u2019s earnings or losses and decreased by cash distributions from the\ninvestee. The Company eliminates from its financial results all significant intercompany transactions to the extent of its ownership interest, including the\nintercompany portion of transactions with equity method investee. The Company\u2019s share of the investee\u2019s income or loss is recorded on a one quarter lag.\nThe Company evaluates its equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the\ninvestment may not be recoverable. If the Company determines a decline in the fair value of an equity method investment below its carrying value is other-than-\ntemporary, an impairment is recorded. Determining fair value involves significant judgment. The Company\u2019s estimates consider alternative evidence including,\nbut not limited to, general economic conditions and other relevant factors. The Company did not recognize any impairment losses for its equity method\ninvestments for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nLeases\nNextNav leases office space under a non-cancellable lease as well as site leases for towers and shelters under operating leases related to its network under\nconstruction.

    "text": "NEXTNAV INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company\u2019s lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Payments under the lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease\ncomponents primarily include payments for utilities and maintenance. The Company combines fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments\nand accounts for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of the Company\u2019s lease assets and liabilities. Certain lease agreements\ncontain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets and liabilities. These amounts include payments for common\narea maintenance.\nLease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to\ndetermine the present value of the future lease payments is the Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in the Company\u2019s\nleases is not readily determinable. The Company\u2019s incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar\nterms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Lease assets are reduced by landlord incentives, plus any direct costs\nfrom executing the leases or lease prepayments reclassified from \u201cOther current assets\u201d upon lease commencement.\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are included on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet beginning January 1, 2022. Operating lease expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Monthly rent expense includes any site related utility payments or other fees such as administrative or\nup-front fees contained in the lease agreements that are determinable upon execution of the lease agreement.\nProperty and Equipment, Network under Construction and Intangible Assets\nProperty and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation and network under construction are recorded at cost. Employee-related costs for construction of\nnetwork assets are also capitalized during the construction phase. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs that do not materially extend the useful lives of\nproperty and equipment are charged to cost of goods sold (\u201cCOGS\u201d) and selling, general and administrative (\u201cSG&A\u201d) as incurred. When property or\nequipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the related property accounts are relieved of costs and accumulated depreciation and any resulting gain or loss is\nincluded in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss.\nNextNav records asset retirement obligations associated with the contractually required removal of property and equipment assets from leased properties.\nWhen an asset retirement obligation is identified, NextNav records the fair value of the obligation discounted at present value as a liability. The fair value of the\nobligation is also capitalized as property and equipment, which is amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the associated asset. Accretion expense\non the liability is recognized over the estimated life of the related assets.

NextNav has not capitalized development costs for software to be sold, leased or marketed to date, as the software\ndevelopment process is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility. As such, these costs are expensed as incurred and\nrecognized in research and development costs in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss.\nSoftware developed for internal use, with no substantive plans to market such software at the time of development, are capitalized and included in\nintangible assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Costs incurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation and post implementation stages of the\nproject are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage of the project are capitalized. In 2022 and 2021, the Company\ncapitalized $0.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of development costs related to internal use software.\nInternal use software is amortized over a 3 year useful life. Amortization of internal use software was $0.4 million and $0.3 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\nAcquired finite-lived intangible assets\nAcquired finite-lived intangible assets primarily includes proprietary technology and software. See Note 3 \u2014 Acquisition.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination.\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\nasset may be impaired. The Company operates as one reporting unit. When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company may first perform an optional\nqualitative assessment. If the Company determines it is not more likely than not the reporting unit\u2019s fair value is less than its carrying value, then no further\nanalysis is necessary. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the\nquantitative impairment test will be performed. Under the quantitative impairment test, if the carrying amount of the Company\u2019s reporting unit exceeds its fair\nvalue, the Company will recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess but limited to the total amount of goodwill.

Certain general regulatory requirements apply to all licensed\nwireless spectrum, including, for example, certain build-out or \u201csubstantial service\u201d requirements, which generally must be satisfied as a condition to the\nlicense. NextNav is actively engaged in either meeting such requirements currently or seeking an extension of such requirements from the Federal\nCommunications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) for each of its LMS licenses. Although licenses are issued by the FCC for only a fixed time, ten years, such licenses are\nsubject to renewal by the FCC, based on the achievement of certain milestones and a finding that such renewal would serve the public interest. Upon renewal,\nthe licenses are granted for additional ten-year periods. All of NextNav\u2019s licenses are up for renewal at the same time. Renewal of NextNav\u2019s licenses has\noccurred previously and at nominal cost. As a result, NextNav treats its wireless LMS spectrum licenses as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. NextNav\nreevaluates the useful life determination for wireless licenses each year to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful\nlife. Costs incurred to maintain the FCC licenses are recorded in operating expenses.\nNextNav assesses indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment annually as of October 1 or during the year if an event or other circumstance\nindicates that NextNav may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset. In evaluating indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, NextNav\nfirst assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. If NextNav\nconcludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value, then no further testing is required. However, if NextNav\nconcludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value, then NextNav performs a two-step impairment test to\nidentify potential impairment and measures the amount of impairment it will recognize, if any.\nBased on its qualitative assessment performed for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, NextNav concluded that it was not more likely than not\nthat the fair value of its indefinite-lived asset is less than its carrying amount, and as such, no impairment exists.\nAcquisitions\nThe Company accounts for its acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price is attributed to the fair value of the assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets and liabilities acquired or\nassumed are measured separately at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price of acquisition over the fair value of the\nidentifiable net assets of the acquiree is recorded as goodwill. The results of businesses acquired are included in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial\nstatements from the date of acquisition.\nWhen the Company issues stock-based or cash awards to an acquired company\u2019s shareholders, the Company evaluates whether the awards are\nconsideration or compensation for post-acquisition services. The evaluation includes, among other things, whether the vesting of the awards is contingent on the\ncontinued employment of the acquired company\u2019s stockholders beyond the acquisition date",

If continued employment is required for vesting, the awards are\ntreated as compensation for post-acquisition services and recognized as expense over the requisite service period.\nDetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, including the\nselection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, discount rates, and selection of comparable companies. The estimates and\nassumptions used to determine the fair values and useful lives of identified intangible assets could change due to numerous factors, including market conditions,\ntechnological developments, economic conditions, and competition. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the\nCompany may record adjustments to the fair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to\ngoodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded as of the acquisition date.\nThe Company continues to collect information and reevaluates these estimates and assumptions quarterly and records any adjustments to the Company\u2019s\npreliminary estimates to goodwill provided that the Company is within the measurement period.

See Note 3 \u2014 Acquisition. Holders of the warrants do not have the right to income or\nobligation to losses, and the Company did not attribute any net loss to the non-controlling interests for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nRevenue\nNextNav derives its revenue from indoor and dense-urban positioning technology, products and services including revenue generated through technology\ndemonstration and assessment contracts with customers, support services provided to customers, sales of equipment, and licensing of proprietary technology.\nThe Company recognizes revenue when an arrangement exists, services, equipment or access to licensed technology are delivered, the transaction price is\ndetermined, the arrangement has commercial substance, payment terms are determined and collection of consideration is probable.\nThe Company sells software licenses and services through arrangements that may bundle software, equipment, and other services. When the Company\ndetermines that it has separate distinct performance obligations, the Company allocates the bundled contract price among the various performance obligations\nbased on each deliverable\u2019s stand-alone selling price. If the stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, the Company estimates the amount to be\nallocated for each performance obligation based on observable market transactions. When the Company determines the performance obligations are not distinct,\nthe Company recognizes revenue on a combined basis as the obligation is satisfied. To the extent the Company\u2019s contracts include variable consideration, the\ntransaction price includes both fixed and variable consideration. The variable consideration contained within the Company\u2019s contracts with customers may\ninclude discounts, credits and other similar items. When a contract includes variable consideration, the Company evaluates the estimate of the variable\nconsideration to determine whether the estimate needs to be constrained; therefore, the Company includes the variable consideration in the transaction price\nonly to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated\nwith the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.\nNextNav recognizes equipment sales and the related costs when control of the equipment passes to the customer, typically upon shipment. The Company\nhas made an accounting policy election to account for shipping activities, consisting of direct costs to ship products performed after the control of a product has\nbeen transferred to the customer, in cost of goods sold. Customers do not have rights of return without NextNav\u2019s prior consent. Revenue pursuant to licensing\nagreements for NextNav\u2019s technology represents performance obligations that are satisfied over time. NextNav recognizes revenue from initial integration\nservices and ongoing services ratably over the periods in which the services are provided; the related costs are expensed as incurred.\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, and deferred revenue on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. The Company bills amounts under its agreed-upon contractual terms at periodic intervals for services, upon shipment for\nequipment, or upon achievement of contractual milestones or as work progresses.

    "text": "NEXTNAV INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in recognizing certain\nincome, expense and credit items for financial reporting purposes and tax reporting purposes. Such deferred income taxes primarily relate to the difference\nbetween the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted\nstatutory tax rates applicable to the future years in which deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized. Excess tax benefits and tax\ndeficiencies are recognized in the income tax provision in the period in which they occur.\nThe Company records a valuation allowance when it determines, based on available positive and negative evidence, that it is more-likely-than-not that\nsome portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company determines the realizability of its deferred tax assets primarily based on the\nreversal of existing taxable temporary differences and projections of future taxable income (exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards). In\nevaluating such projections, the Company considers its history of profitability, the competitive environment, and general economic conditions. In addition, the\nCompany considers the time frame over which it would take to utilize the deferred tax assets prior to their expiration.\nFor certain tax positions, the Company uses a more-likely-than-not threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken. Tax positions that\nmeet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured at the largest amount of tax benefits determined on a cumulative probability basis, which are\nmore-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. The Company\u2019s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to\nincome tax matters in income tax expense.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of NextNav\u2019s foreign subsidiaries is generally the local currency. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the\nexchange rate in effect at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date. Operating accounts are translated at an average rate of exchange for the respective accounting\nperiods. Translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating foreign currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are reported as a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive loss. Transaction gains and losses reflected in the functional currencies are charged to income or expense at the time of the\ntransaction.\nNet transaction gains (losses) from foreign currency contracts recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss were immaterial for the\nfiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The only component of other comprehensive loss is currency translation adjustments for all periods presented.\nNo income tax expense was allocated to the currency translation adjustments.\nSegments\nNextNav operates as one operating segment. NextNav\u2019s chief operating decision maker is its Chief Executive Officer, who reviews financial information\npresented on an entity-wide basis for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance and allocating resources. Substantially all long-\nlived tangible assets are located in the United States, except for the acquired intangible assets. See Note 3\u2014 Acquisition.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, two customers accounted for 83% and 10% of total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2021, three\ncustomers accounted for 40%, 31%, and 19% of total revenue.\nF-15",

ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset\nrepresenting its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The new guidance also requires qualitative and\nquantitative disclosures related to the nature, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. In July 2018, the FASB amended the new lease standard\nwhich, among other changes, allows a company to elect to adopt ASU 2016-02 using a transition option whereby a cumulative effect adjustment is recorded to\nthe opening balance of its retained earnings on the adoption date. The Company has elected to use this modified retrospective transition option and recorded a\ncumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of $0.5 million, net of tax, as of January 1, 2022. The Company also elected certain practical expedients\npermitted under the transition guidance, including to retain the historical lease classification as well as relief from reviewing expired or existing contracts to\ndetermine if they contain leases. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 resulted in the recognition of operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities of $13.4 million\nand $10.5 million, respectively. The standard did not have a significant effect on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss and Cash\nFlows. See Note 5 for additional lease disclosures.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-02, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740) (\u201cASU 2019-12\u201d), which is intended to\nimprove consistency and simplify several areas of existing guidance. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles related to the approach\nfor intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis\ndifferences. ASU 2019-12 is effective for the Company\u2019s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2022. The Company adopted this ASU as of January 1, 2022. The\nadoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from\nContracts with Customers (\u201cASU 2021-08\u201d). The ASU requires an acquiring entity to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in\na business combination in accordance with Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, rather than at fair value.

The guidance also modifies the impairment\nmodel for available-for-sale debt securities. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company\u2019s fiscal year beginning January 1, 2023.

Acquisition\nOn October 31, 2022 (the \u201cClosing Date\u201d), the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding equity in Nestwave, a privately held French\ncompany that is a global leader in low-power geolocation. The acquisition is expected to significantly accelerate the availability of resilient 3D position,\nnavigation and timing, release the underlying spectrum\u2019s capacity for additional data-oriented services and enables broader penetration of NextNav\u2019s\napplications and technology across the handset and device ecosystem for all of its products and target markets. The acquisition is accounted for under the\nacquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805.\nThe Company acquired Nestwave for $21.6 million, net of cash acquired of $0.4 million. The purchase price for financial reporting purpose includes\n$3.2 million cash paid upfront and $0.8 million payable on or prior to first anniversary of the Closing Date, an aggregate of 5,170,495 shares of the Company's\ncommon stock valued at $17.7 million, and cash contingent consideration of up to $0.3 million. The fair value of the Company's common stock was determined\non the basis of its closing market price on the Closing Date. Contingent consideration was measured based on government grants and tax credits Nestwave\nexpects to receive, and will be settled within one year of Closing Date. During the fourth quarter of 2022, there was no change to the fair value estimate of\ncontingent consideration liability. The Company paid $0.1 million in cash to settle a portion of the contingent consideration liability. The Company incurred\nacquisition-related costs of $0.9 million associated with the acquisition and were included in the selling, general and administrative expenses in the 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss.\nThe earnings of Nestwave have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company beginning November 1, 2022. The pro forma\nfinancial information, assuming the acquisition had taken place on January 1, 2021, as well as the revenue and earnings generated during the period after the\nacquisition date, were not material for separate disclosure and, accordingly, have not been presented.\nThe fair value measurements of the identified intangible assets on acquisition date were based primarily on significant unobservable inputs and thus\nrepresent a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements. The fair values of technology and software were determined using the\nreplacement cost method under the cost approach. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired\nwas recognized as goodwill and is attributable to a number of business factors, including but not limited to, the acquired workforce and expanded market\nopportunities when integrating Nestwave\u2019s software and technology with the Company\u2019s other offerings. Goodwill generated from the acquisition is not\ndeductible for tax purposes.\nAs of the acquisition date, the purchase price assigned to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities is summarized as follows. The purchase price\nallocation is preliminary and subject to revision as additional information about deferred taxes becomes available. Although final determination may result in\ndifferent asset and liability fair values, it is not expected that such differences will be material to understanding the impact of the transaction on the financial\nresults of the Company.\n(in thousands)\nCash acquired $ 433\nOther current assets ",

Fair Value\nNextNav uses observable and unobservable inputs to determine the value of its assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. Observable inputs reflect\nmarket data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect internal market assumptions. The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used to\nmeasure fair value, which prioritizes the inputs used in the methodologies of measuring fair value for assets and liabilities, where applicable, is as follows:\n- Level 1 \u2014 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n- Level 2 \u2014 Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities\n- Level 3 \u2014 No observable pricing inputs in the market\nAssets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. NextNav\u2019s\nassessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the assets and liabilities\nbeing measured and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. NextNav effectuates transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy, if any, as of the\ndate of the actual circumstance that caused the transfer.\nThe following table presents the Company\u2019s fair value hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n(in thousands)\nDecember 31, 2022\nCash and Cash Equivalents - Money Market Funds $ 95 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 95\nCash and Cash Equivalents - U.S. Government Agency Bonds \u2014 36,509 \u2014 36,509\nShort term investments - U.S. Government Agency Bonds \u2014 8,216 \u2014 8,216\nWarrants \u2014 \u2014 4,200 4,200\nDecember 31, 2021\nWarrants $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 28,875 $ 28,875\nThe carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accrued expenses, amounts included in other current assets, and current liabilities that\nmeet the definition of a financial instrument, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.\nAssets, liabilities, and equity instruments that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include fixed assets and intangible assets. The Company\nrecognizes these items at fair value when they are considered to be impaired or upon initial recognition. The fair value of these assets and liabilities are\ndetermined with valuation techniques using the best information available and may include quoted market prices, market comparables and discounted cash flow\nmodels.\nLevel 3 Liabilities\nThe Company engaged a third-party valuation firm to assist with the fair value analysis of the warrants. The analysis used commonly accepted valuation\nmethodologies and best practices to determine the fair value of the equity, in accordance with fair value standards and U.S. GAAP. For the Private Placement\nWarrants that were outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, NextNav used a Monte Carlo simulation model.

The expected term of option awards is calculated as the midpoint between the\nvesting date and the end of the contractual term. Historical data is not sufficient to reasonably estimate the expected term of new grants. The expected dividend\nrate of zero is based on the fact that NextNav has not historically paid and does not expect to pay a dividend on its common stock.

Additionally, the difference in the Company\u2019s effective tax rate to the statutory rate is driven by the need for a\nfull valuation allowance in the U.S.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December of 2017 requires certain Global Intangible Low Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) earned by a controlled foreign\ncorporation (\u201cCFC\u201d) to be included in the gross income of the CFC\u2019s U.S. shareholder. The Company has elected the \u201cperiod cost method\u201d and treats taxes due\non future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company has accumulated undistributed earnings generated by Commlabs India of approximately $0.2 million. The\nCompany has an accumulated deficit with respect to Nestwave. Because all of these earnings generated by Commlabs have previously been subject to the one-\ntime transition tax on foreign earnings required by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, any additional taxes due with respect to such earnings or the excess of the\namount for financial reporting over the tax basis of the Company\u2019s foreign investments would generally be limited to foreign and state taxes.

    "text": "NEXTNAV INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nManagement assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of\nthe existing deferred tax assets (\u201cDTA\u201d). A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year\nperiod ended December 31, 2021. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as the Company\u2019s projections for future\ngrowth.\nOn the basis of this evaluation, as of December 31, 2022, a valuation allowance of $88.9 million has been recorded because management has concluded\nthat it is more likely than not that such DTA will ultimately not be realized. The amount of the DTA considered realizable, however, could be adjusted in future\nyears if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative\nlosses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021 the Company did not have any unrecognized income tax benefits.\nThe Company has U.S. income tax net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of $76.0 million and $36.4 million as of December 31, 2022, and 2021,\nrespectively. $5.0 million of the NOL\u2019s are expected to expire beginning in 2027 while the remaining $71.0 million can be carried forward indefinitely. The\nCompany\u2019s NOLs in the U.S. may be limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d). NOLs are limited when there is a significant ownership\nchange as defined by the IRC Section 382. At this time, the Company expects that none of its federal NOLs will expire unutilized as a result of a limitation\nunder Section 382.\nThe Company had foreign NOLs as of December 31, 2022 of $5.8 million attributable to Nestwave and an immaterial amount of state NOLs.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the United States, various states within the United States, India, and France. Each jurisdiction has its own statute of\nlimitations for making assessment of additional tax liabilities. As of December 31, 2022, due to its net operating losses, all the Company\u2019s tax years remained\nopen for U.S. Federal and state income tax purposes. India has a 4-year statute of limitations, so years prior to 2017 are closed. France has a statute of\nlimitation tax expires 3 years following the year that triggered the liability.\n14. Retirement Plan\nNextNav sponsors a defined contribution benefit plan to provide retirement benefits for its employees. Participants may make voluntary contributions not\nto exceed maximum allowable contribution amounts. NextNav made discretionary contributions and matching contributions, totaling $0.3 million for each of\nthe years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n15. Subsequent Events\nThe Company has completed an evaluation of all subsequent events through the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K to ensure that these financial\nstatements include appropriate disclosure of events both recognized in the financial statements and events which occurred but were not recognized in the\nfinancial statements. The Company has concluded that no subsequent event has occurred that require disclosure",

    "text": "Dear Fellow Shareholder,\nWe are pleased to provide you an update on the progress of your investments in ACRES\nCommercial Realty Corp. (\u201cACR\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d). During the past year, our manager has\ncontinued to make progress on the core tenets of its responsibilities to manage the existing assets\nin the portfolio, originate new loan assets, facilitate the financing of the assets, and control costs\nto drive earnings and increase book value per share. We are pleased to report that substantial\nprogress has been made on all fronts and we remain focused on these mandates going forward.\nThe ACRES team continued to diligently manage our assets and provide exceptional service for\nour borrowers. We worked proactively with these borrowers to address their needs so that they\ncould maintain payments on their loans. These efforts have resulted in a high-quality, stabilized\nbook to build on.\nWe are proud of the success we achieved in 2022 and are optimistic in our ability to deliver\nshareholder value over the long term.\nSelective Growth & Attractive Financing Vehicles\nDuring 2022, we selectively grew the Company\u2019s loan portfolio by leveraging ACRES\u2019s\ncomplementary lending pipeline and network of sponsor relationships. We are pleased to note that\nwe closed over $610 million of commercial real estate first-mortgage commitments in 2022.\nAdditionally, we carefully pursued opportunities to make direct equity investments in real estate\nin 2022, ultimately acquiring two properties for a total of $51.6 million. We expect that these\ninvestments may yield enhanced returns in the long term that, we will be able to substantially\nshield from taxes due to the existence of ACR\u2019s considerable tax assets and ultimately reinvest\ninto the loan origination pipeline.\nWe recognize that building on this momentum is essential. Therefore, the ACRES team is vigilant\nin identifying and executing on opportunities to grow asset-specific financing with duration at\nattractive coupon rates that can raise our capacity to originate loans. In addition, we have the\nreinvestment window available on our two ACR securitizations through May 2023 and December\n2023. The bulk of the Company\u2019s current portfolio was originated in 2021 and 2022, comprising\n84% of the current par balance and have initial maturities of 2024 or later and extended maturities\nof 2026 or later.\nPortfolio Stability\nThe ACRES asset management team prides itself on its ability to tailor solutions that will keep\nborrowers on track despite challenges that may arise. Current volatility and uncertainty in the\nmarket have proved to be such challenges, but ones we\u2019ve been able to manage as a result of our\nproactive asset management approach.\nThanks to our asset management team, we\u2019ve reduced our watch list to 5% of the loan portfolio at\nthe end of 2022, down from 8% at the end of 2021. In January 2023, one watch list loan, a hotel\nportfolio in the southwest region with a par value of $56.5 million was paid off in full, which\nreduced the value of our watch list loans in half as compared to year end 2022.",

    "text": "As of December 31, 2022, 95% of the loan portfolio was performing in line or near underwritten\nexpectations and a significant majority of loans were current on contractual payments, which is an\nimprovement from 92% at December 31, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2022, 100% of our loan portfolio by carrying value earned a floating rate of\ninterest and was financed entirely with liabilities that both pay interest at floating rates.\nAdditionally, 89% of the par value of our floating-rate loan portfolio was covered by borrower-\nowned interest rate caps that provided additional credit protection to the Company in the current\nrising interest rate environment.\nCapital Markets Flexibility\nWe worked closely with our lenders and executed as planned to provide the Company maximum\nflexibility given the challenging business environment in 2022.\nWe finalized terms with Mass Mutual under its non-mark-to-market agreement to upsize the\ncommitment and to provide for individual loan series that will each have a five-year term from the\ndate of issuance. Additionally, we have warehouse lines open with JPM and Morgan Stanley, each\ncollateralized by performing loans and each with excess capacity to support future originations.\nIn August 2022, we repaid the remaining outstanding 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes upon\nmaturity at par.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 849,000 shares of common stock at an\naverage price of $10.35, which contributed $1.32 per share to common stock book value since we\nwere able to repurchase the shares at prices significantly below our common stock book value.\nCommon stock book value was $24.54 at December 31, 2022, up 3% from December 31, 2021.\nCorporate Responsibility\nIn undertaking our ESG strategy, we are particularly focused on identifying and executing\nprograms that ensure our dedication to diversity and inclusion and emphasize ethical behavior.\nWe are committed to integrating ESG policies and practices into our operational, investment and\ndevelopment strategies to build a sustainable future.\nDuring 2022, we announced a new initiative called \u201cACRES Protects an Acre\u201d initiative, in which\nACRES will make a donation in connection with each loan it closes to a nonprofit organization\nwhose mission is to protect acres of vulnerable land. Additionally, early in 2023, we announced a\npartnership with Project Destined, an organization that provides training in financial literacy,\nentrepreneurship, and real estate to students from underserved communities.\nLooking Ahead\nAs we look ahead to 2023, we have established a goal to get the Company fully invested to drive\nmeaningful earnings that can be re-invested back into the loan origination pipeline. We expect our\naccomplishments in 2022 will help to pave the way to attaining that goal.",

    "text": "PART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral\nWe are a Maryland corporation, incorporated in 2005, and a real estate finance company that is organized and conducts our\noperations to qualify as a real estate investment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d) for federal income tax purposes under Subchapter M of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. On February 16, 2021, we amended our certificate of incorporation to change our\nname to ACRES Commercial Realty Corp. from Exantas Capital Corp. Our investment strategy is primarily focused on originating,\nholding and managing commercial real estate (\u201cCRE\u201d) mortgage loans and equity investments in commercial real estate property\nthrough direct ownership and joint ventures. We are externally managed by ACRES Capital, LLC (our \u201cManager\u201d) a subsidiary of\nACRES Capital Corp. (collectively \u201cACRES\u201d), a private commercial real estate lender exclusively dedicated to nationwide middle\nmarket CRE lending with a focus on multifamily, student housing, hospitality, industrial and office property in top United States, or\nU.S., markets. Our Manager draws upon the management team of ACRES and its collective investment experience to provide its\nservices.\nOur objective is to provide our stockholders with total returns over time, including the payment of quarterly distributions when\napproved by our board of directors, (our \u201cBoard\u201d) and capital appreciation, while seeking to manage the risks associated with our\ninvestment strategies. We finance a substantial portion of our portfolio investments through borrowing strategies seeking to match the\nmaturities and repricing dates of our financings with the maturities and repricing dates of our investments.\nOur investment strategy targets the following CRE credit investments, including:\n\u2022 Floating-rate first mortgage loans, which we refer to as whole loans;\n\u2022 First priority interests in first mortgage loans, which we refer to as A-notes;\n\u2022 Subordinated interests in first mortgage loans, which we refer to as B-notes;\n\u2022 Preferred equity investments related to CRE that are subordinate to first mortgage loans and are not collateralized by the\nproperty underlying the investment; and\n\u2022 CRE equity investments.\nWe generate our income primarily from the spread between the revenues we receive from our assets and the cost to finance our\nownership of those assets, including corporate debt.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) was identified. The resulting spread of COVID-19 throughout\nthe globe led the World Health Organization to designate COVID-19 as a pandemic and numerous countries, including the U.S, to\ndeclare national emergencies. Many countries responded to the initial and ensuing outbreaks of COVID-19 by instituting quarantines\nand restrictions on travel and limiting operations of non-essential offices and retail centers, which resulted in the closure or remote\noperation of non-essential businesses and increased rates of unemployment and market disruption in connection with the economic\nuncertainty. While the U.S. and certain countries around the world have eased restrictions and financial markets and unemployment\nrates have stabilized to some degree, the pandemic continues to cause uncertainty in the U.S. and global economies, generally, and the\nCRE industry in particular.\nThe aforementioned quarantines and travel restrictions contributed significantly to economic disruptions across the country\nthat directly impacted our borrowers and their ability to pay and to stay current with their debt obligations in 2019 and 2020, causing\nsignificant increases in our provisions for credit losses. During this height of the pandemic, we used",

During this height of the pandemic, we used a variety of legal and structural\noptions to manage credit risk effectively, including through forbearance and extension provisions or agreements. As of December 31,\n2022, we have substantially reversed those provisions due to significant improvements in our current and expected macroeconomic\noperating environments as well as due to improvements in collateral operating performance and market liquidity.\nWe continue to actively and responsibly manage corporate liquidity and operations in light of the market disruptions caused by\nCOVID-19. However, it is inherently difficult to accurately assess the continuing impact of the pandemic as well as other domestic or\nglobal events on our revenues, profitability and financial position. In response, we are focused on maintaining sufficient liquidity while\nstill growing our loan origination business. We continuously monitor the effects of domestic and global events on our operations and\nfinancial position to ensure that we remain responsive and adaptable to the dynamic changes in our operating environment.\nThe negative impact of COVID-19 on our commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, investments and 2020 results\ncreated a net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards and net capital loss carryforwards (\u201cCLCFs\u201d). Our 2020 tax return, completed in\nOctober 2021, resulted in NOL carryforwards of $47.7 million and CLCFs of $136.9 million, including net capital loss carryforwards\n5",

Our 2021 tax return, completed in October 2022, resulted in NOL\nutilization of $1.1 million and CLCF utilization of $15.0 million. Additionally, we have NOL carryforwards of $60.1 million and CLCFs\nof $1.0 million at our taxable REIT subsidiaries (\u201cTRSs\u201d).\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have acquired equity investments in CRE properties to utilize CLCFs in our QRSs. These equity\ninvestments offer the opportunity for enhanced capital appreciation returns that may be reinvested into the loan origination pipeline\nwhen and if realized.\nWe typically target transitional floating-rate CRE loans between $10.0 million and $100.0 million. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 we originated 19 CRE loans with total commitments of $610.8 million. At December 31, 2022, our CRE loan\nportfolio comprised $2.1 billion of floating-rate CRE whole loans with a weighted average spread of 3.78% over the one-month\nbenchmark interest rates utilized, which have a weighted average floor of 0.68%, excluding one whole loan without a benchmark floor.\nAdditionally, our CRE loan portfolio comprised one fully reserved $4.7 million mezzanine loan at December 31, 2022.\nOur Business Strategy\nThe core components of our business strategy are:\nInvestment in CRE assets. We are currently invested in CRE whole loans, CRE mezzanine loans and CRE investments. Our\ngoal is to allocate 90% to 100% of our equity to our CRE assets.\nManaging our investment portfolio. At December 31, 2022, we managed $2.1 billion of assets, including $1.5 billion of assets\nthat were financed and held in variable interest entities. The core of our management process is credit analysis, which our Manager,\nwith the assistance of ACRES, uses to actively monitor our existing investments and as a basis for evaluating new investments. Senior\nmanagement of ACRES has extensive experience in underwriting the credit risk associated with our targeted asset classes and conducts\ndetailed due diligence on all investments. After we make investments, our Manager actively monitors them for early detection of trouble\nor deterioration. If a default occurs, we will use our senior management team\u2019s asset management experience in seeking to mitigate the\nseverity of any loss and to optimize the recovery from assets collateralizing the investment.\nManaging our interest rate, pricing and liquidity risk. We engage in a number of business activities that are vulnerable to\ninterest rate, pricing and liquidity risk and we seek to manage those risks. The risks on our long-term financing agreements, principally\nour term financing facilities, are managed by seeking to match the maturity and repricing dates of our financed investments with the\nmaturities and repricing dates of our long-term financing facilities. Additionally, we seek to match investment and financing maturity\nand repricing dates using securitization vehicles structured by our Manager and, subject to the availability of markets for securitization\nfinancings, we expect to continue to use securitizations in the future to accomplish our long-term match funding financing strategy.\nAt December 31, 2022, our CRE securitizations, financing facilities with debt outstanding, and mortgage payable were",

As funds become available for investment or reinvestment, we seek to maintain diversification by\nproperty type and geographic location while allocating our capital to investment opportunities that we believe are the most economically\nattractive. The percentage of assets that we have invested in certain non-qualifying, non-core and other real estate-related investments\nis subject to the federal income tax requirements for REIT qualification and the requirements for exclusion from regulation under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940, or the Investment Company Act.\nOur Operating Policies\nInvestment guidelines. We have established investment policies, procedures and guidelines that are reviewed and approved by\nour Manager\u2019s investment committee and our Board. The investment committee and/or our Board, as applicable, meets regularly to\nconsider and approve proposed specific investments. Our Board monitors the execution of our overall investment strategies and targeted\nasset classes. We acquire our investments primarily for income. We do not have a policy that requires us to focus our investments in\none or more particular geographic areas or industries.\nFinancing policies. We use leverage in order to increase potential returns to our stockholders and for financing our portfolio.\nWe do not speculate on changes in interest rates. Although we have identified leverage targets for each of our targeted asset classes, our\ninvestment policies do not have any minimum or maximum leverage limits. Our Manager\u2019s investment committee has the discretion,\nwithout the need for further approval by our Board, to increase the amount of leverage we incur above our targeted range for individual\nasset classes subject, however, to any leverage constraints that may be imposed by existing financing arrangements.\nWe use borrowing and securitization strategies to accomplish our long-term match funding financing strategy. Based upon\ncurrent conditions in the credit markets for collateralized debt obligations and collateralized loan obligations (sometimes, collectively,\nreferred to as CDOs and CLOs) we expect to modestly increase leverage through new CRE debt securitizations and the continued use\nof our senior secured financing facility and term financing facilities. We may also seek other credit arrangements to finance new\ninvestments that we believe can generate attractive risk-adjusted returns, subject to availability.\nCredit and risk management policies.

In a business environment where benchmark interest rates are\nincreasing significantly, cash flows of the CRE assets underlying our loans may not be sufficient to pay debt service on our loans, which\ncould result in non-performance or default. We partially mitigate this risk by generally requiring our borrowers to purchase interest rate\ncap agreements with non-affiliated, well-capitalized third parties and by selectively requiring our borrowers to have and maintain debt\nservice reserves. These interest rate caps generally mature prior to the maturity date of the loan and the borrowers are required to pay to\nextend them. In most cases the sponsors will need to fund additional equity into the properties to cover these costs as the property may\nnot generate sufficient cash flow to pay these costs. At December 31, 2022, 88.8% of the par value of our CRE loan portfolio had interest\nrate caps in place with a weighted-average maturity of 1.1 years.\nHistorically, we have used the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as the benchmark interest rate for our floating-rate\nwhole loans and we have been exposed to LIBOR through our floating-rate borrowings. Many of our floating-rate whole loans, CRE\nsecuritizations and term warehouse financing facilities included one-month LIBOR as the original contractual benchmark interest rate.\nOur unsecured junior subordinated debentures use three-month LIBOR as the contractual benchmark interest rate. In March 2021, the\nUnited Kingdom\u2019s, or U.K.\u2019s, Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) announced that it would cease publication of the one-week and the\ntwo-month USD LIBOR immediately after December 31, 2021, and cease publication of the remaining tenors immediately after June\n30, 2023. In July 2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee\ncomprising large U.S. financial institutions, has identified Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its preferred alternative rate\nfor LIBOR.\nAll variable rate loans originated by us beginning January 1, 2022 have been benchmarked to SOFR. Additionally, all of our\nfloating-rate whole loans contain provisions that provide for the transition of the contractual benchmark interest rate to an alternative\nrate. At December 31, 2022, our loan portfolio had a carrying value of $2.0 billion of floating rate loans, 68.3% or $1.4 billion of which\nhave interest rates tied to LIBOR and 31.7% or $646.2 million of which have interest rates tied to SOFR.\n7",

Additionally, during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, we entered into a loan agreement to finance the acquisition of a student housing complex, which uses SOFR as its\nbenchmark interest rate.

We predominantly originate floating-rate first mortgage loans, or whole loans, directly to\nborrowers. The direct origination of whole loans enables us to better control the structure of the loans and to maintain direct lending\nrelationships with borrowers. Additionally, we may acquire whole loans from third parties that conform to our investment strategy. We\nmay create tranches of a loan we originate, consisting of an A-note (described below) and a B-note (described below), as well as\nmezzanine loans or other participations, which we may hold or sell to third parties. We do not obtain ratings on these investments. With\nrespect to our portfolio at December 31, 2022, our whole loan investments had loan-to-collateral value, or LTV, ratios that typically do\nnot exceed 85%. Typically, our whole loans are structured with an original term of up to three years, with one-year extensions that bring\nthe loan to a maximum term of five years. Substantially all of our CRE loans held at December 31, 2022 were whole loans. We expect\nto hold our whole loans to maturity.\nSenior interests in whole loans (A-notes). We may invest in senior interests in whole loans, referred to as A-notes, either\ndirectly originated or purchased from third parties. We do not intend to obtain ratings on these investments. We expect our typical A-\nnote investments to have LTV ratios not exceeding 70% and will generally be structured with an original term of up to three years, with\none-year extensions that bring the loan to a maximum term of five years. We expect to hold any A-note investments to maturity. We did\nnot hold any A-note investments at December 31, 2022.\n8",

    "text": "Subordinate interests in whole loans (B-notes). To a lesser extent, we may invest in subordinate interests in whole loans,\nreferred to as B-notes, which we will either directly originate or purchase from third parties. B-notes are loans secured by a first mortgage\nbut are subordinated to an A-note. The subordination of a B-note is generally evidenced by an intercreditor or participation agreement\nbetween the holders of the A-note and the B-note. In some instances, the B-note lender may require a security interest in the stock or\nother equity interests of the borrower as part of the transaction. B-note lenders have the same obligations, collateral and borrower as the\nA-note lender, but typically are subordinated in recovery upon a default to the A-note lender. B-notes share certain credit characteristics\nwith second mortgages in that both are subject to greater credit risk with respect to the underlying mortgage collateral than the\ncorresponding first mortgage or A-note. We do not intend to obtain ratings on these investments. We expect our typical B-note\ninvestments to have LTV ratios between 55% and 80% and will generally be structured with an original term of up to three years, with\none-year extensions that bring the loan to a maximum term of five years. We expect to hold any B-note investments to maturity. We did\nnot hold any B-note investments at December 31, 2022.\nIn addition to the accrued interest receivable on a B-note, we may earn fees charged to the borrower under the note or additional\nincome by receiving principal payments in excess of the discounted price (below par value) we paid to acquire the note. Our ownership\nof a B-note with controlling class rights may, in the event the financing fails to perform according to its terms, cause us to pursue our\nremedies as owner of the B-note, which may include foreclosure on, or modification of, the note. In some cases, the owner of the A-\nnote may be able to foreclose or modify the note against our wishes as owner of the B-note. As a result, our economic and business\ninterests may diverge from the interests of the owner of the A-note.\nMezzanine financing. Historically, we have invested in mezzanine loans that are senior to the borrower\u2019s equity in, and\nsubordinate to the mortgage loan on, a property. A mezzanine loan is typically secured by a pledge of the ownership interests in the\nentity that directly owns the real property or by a second lien mortgage loan on the property. In addition, mezzanine loans typically\ninclude credit enhancements such as letters of credit, personal guarantees of the principals of the borrower, or collateral unrelated to the\nproperty. A mezzanine loan may be structured so that we receive a stated fixed or variable interest rate on the loan as well as a percentage\nof gross revenues and a percentage of the increase in the fair market value of the property securing the loan, payable upon maturity,\nrefinancing or sale of the property. Mezzanine loans may also have prepayment lockouts, penalties, minimum profit hurdles and other\nmechanisms to protect and enhance returns in the event of premature repayment. At December 31, 2022, our loan portfolio included one\nmezzanine loan with no carrying value.\nPreferred equity investments.

    "text": "Regulatory Aspects of Our Investment Strategy:\nExclusion from Regulation Under the Investment Company Act\nWe operate our business so as to be excluded from regulation under the Investment Company Act. Because we conduct our\nbusiness through wholly-owned subsidiaries, we must ensure not only that we qualify for an exclusion from regulation under the\nInvestment Company Act, but also that each of our subsidiaries also qualifies.\nWe believe that ACRES Realty Funding, Inc., (\u201cACRES RF\u201d) the subsidiary that at December 31, 2022 held substantially all\nof our CRE loan assets, is excluded from Investment Company Act regulation under Section 3(c)(5)(C), a provision designed for\ncompanies that do not issue redeemable securities and are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring\nmortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate. To qualify for this exclusion, at least 55% of ACRES RF\u2019s assets must consist\nof mortgage loans and other assets that are considered the functional equivalent of mortgage loans for purposes of the Investment\nCompany Act and interests in real properties, which we refer to as Qualifying Interests. Moreover, 80% of ACRES RF\u2019s assets must\nconsist of Qualifying Interests and other real estate-related assets. ACRES RF has not issued, and does not intend to issue, redeemable\nsecurities.\nWe treat our investments in CRE whole loans, A-notes, specific types of B-notes and specific types of mezzanine loans as\nQualifying Interests for purposes of determining our eligibility for the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) to the extent such\ntreatment is consistent with guidance provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, or its staff. We believe that SEC\nstaff guidance allows us to treat B-notes as Qualifying Interests where we have unilateral rights to instruct the servicer to foreclose upon\na defaulted mortgage loan, replace the servicer in the event the servicer, in its discretion, elects not to foreclose on such a loan, and\npurchase the A-note in the event of a default on the mortgage loan. We believe, based upon an analysis of existing SEC staff guidance,\nthat we may treat mezzanine loans as Qualifying Interests where (i) the borrower is a special purpose bankruptcy-remote entity whose\nsole purpose is to hold all of the ownership interests in another special purpose entity that owns commercial real property, (ii) both\nentities are organized as limited liability companies or limited partnerships, (iii) under their organizational documents and the loan\ndocuments, neither entity may engage in any other business, (iv) the ownership interests of either entity have no value apart from the\nunderlying real property which is essentially the only asset held by the property-owning entity, (v) the value of the underlying property\nin excess of the amount of senior obligations is in excess of the amount of the mezzanine loan, (vi) the borrower pledges its entire\ninterest in the property-owning entity to the lender which obtains a perfected security interest in the collateral and (vii) the relative rights\nand priorities between the mezzanine lender and the senior lenders with respect to claims on the underlying property are set forth in an\nintercreditor agreement between the parties which gives the mezzanine lender certain cure and purchase rights in case there is a default\non the senior loan.

If the SEC staff provides future guidance that these investments are not Qualifying Interests, then we will treat them,\nfor purposes of determining our eligibility for the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C), as real estate-related assets or miscellaneous\nassets, as appropriate. Historically, we have held \u201cwhole pool certificates\u201d in mortgage loans, although, at December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nwe had no whole pool certificates in our portfolios. Pursuant to existing SEC staff guidance, we consider whole pool certificates to be\nQualifying Interests. A whole pool certificate is a certificate that represents the entire beneficial interest in an underlying pool of\nmortgage loans. By contrast, a certificate that represents less than the entire beneficial interest in the underlying mortgage loans is not\nconsidered to be a Qualifying Interest for purposes of the 55% test, but constitutes a real estate-related asset for purposes of the 80%\ntest.\nTo the extent ACRES RF holds its CRE loan assets through wholly or majority-owned CRE debt securitization vehicles or\nspecial purpose entities, or SPEs, ACRES RF also intends to conduct its operations so that it will not come within the definition of an\ninvestment company set forth in Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act because less than 40% of the value of its total assets\n(exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis will consist of \u201cinvestment securities,\u201d which we refer\nto as the 40% test. \u201cInvestment securities\u201d exclude U.S. government securities and securities of majority-owned subsidiaries that are not\nthemselves investment companies and are not relying on the exception from the definition of investment company under Section 3(c)(1)\nor Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. Certain of the wholly-owned CRE debt securitization subsidiaries of ACRES RF\nrely on Section 3(c)(5)(C) for their Investment Company Act exemption, with the result that ACRES RF\u2019s interests in the CRE debt\nsecuritization subsidiaries do not constitute \u201cinvestment securities\u201d for the purpose of the 40% test.\nOur other subsidiaries, RCC Commercial, Inc., or RCC Commercial, RCC Commercial II, Inc., or Commercial II, RCC\nCommercial III, Inc., or Commercial III, RCC TRS, LLC, or RCC TRS, Resource TRS, LLC, or Resource TRS, and RSO EquityCo,\nLLC, or RSO Equity, do not qualify for the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion.

Moreover, assets acquired by us pursuant to our repurchase\nagreements, warehouse facilities, senior secured financing facility or other short-term financings may not be suitable for refinancing\nthrough long-term arrangements that may require us to liquidate some or all of the related assets.\n\uf0b7 We will incur losses on our repurchase transactions if the counterparty to the transactions defaults on its obligation to resell the\nunderlying assets back to us at the end of the transaction term, or if the value of the underlying assets has declined as of the end of\nthe term or if we default in our obligations to purchase the assets.\n\uf0b7 We may have to repurchase assets that we have sold in connection with CRE debt securitizations and other securitizations.\n\uf0b7 Financing our REIT qualifying assets with repurchase agreements and warehouse facilities could adversely affect our ability to\nqualify as a REIT.\n\uf0b7 Historically, we have financed most of our investments through CRE debt securitizations and have retained the equity.

Although historically we\nhave been able to raise both debt and equity capital, recent market and economic conditions have made obtaining additional equity\ncapital highly dilutive to existing shareholders and may possibly affect our ability to raise debt capital. If current economic conditions\nwere to deteriorate, our ability to access debt or equity capital on acceptable terms, could be further limited, which could limit our ability\nto generate growth, our profitability, our ability to make distributions and the market price of our common stock. In addition, as a REIT,\nwe must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid\nand excluding net capital gain, to our stockholders and are therefore not able to retain significant amounts of our earnings for new\ninvestments, except where the existence of NOL and net capital loss carryforwards enable us to do so. While we may, through our TRSs\nretain earnings as new capital, we are subject to REIT qualification requirements that limit the value of TRS stock and securities relative\nto the other assets owned by a REIT.\nThe outbreak of widespread contagious disease, such as COVID-19, has caused, and may continue to cause, disruptions to the U.S.\nand global economy and to our business, which has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial condition,\nour results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources.\nIn December 2019, COVID-19 was identified and the resulting global proliferation of the virus led the World Health\nOrganization to designate COVID-19 as a pandemic and numerous countries, including the U.S., to declare national emergencies. Many\ncountries have responded to the outbreak by instituting quarantines and restrictions on travel, which has resulted in the closure or remote\noperation of non-essential businesses. While the U.S. and certain countries around the world have eased restrictions and financial markets\nand unemployment rates have stabilized to some degree, the pandemic continues to cause uncertainty on the U.S. and global economies,\ngenerally, and the CRE business in particular.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on our financial condition, liquidity\nand results of operations and the market price of our common stock and preferred stock. We expect that these impacts are likely to\ncontinue to some extent as the longer-term macro-economic effects of the pandemic continue. Although many or all facets of our\nbusiness have been or could be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we currently believe the following impacts to be among the most\nmaterial to us:\n\u2022 COVID-19 could have a significant long-term impact on the broader economy and the CRE market generally, which would\nnegatively impact the value of the properties collateralizing our loans. Our portfolio includes loans collateralized by hotel,\nretail, office, multifamily and other property types that are particularly negatively impacted by the pandemic.

When utilized,\nif we do not have the funds available to make required payments, it would likely result in defaults under the particular\nfacilities affected that, because of cross-default provisions, could result in defaults under other debt instruments as well as\npotential loss of our assets to the lenders unless we are able to raise the funds from alternative sources, including by selling\nor financing assets or raising capital, each of which we may be required to do under adverse market conditions or at an\ninopportune time or on unfavorable terms, or may be unable to do at all.

If we cannot meet lender requirements related\nto margin calls or other terms of our credit agreements, the lender or counterparty could accelerate our indebtedness,\nincrease the interest rate on advanced funds and terminate our ability to borrow additional funds, which would materially\nand adversely affect our financial condition and ability to implement our investment strategy.\n\u2022 The COVID-19 pandemic has in the past reduced, and may reduce, the availability of liquidity sources, but our\nrequirements for liquidity, including future funding commitments and potential margin calls, likely will not be\ncommensurately reduced. If we do not have funds available to meet our obligations, we would have to raise funds from\nalternative sources, which may be at unfavorable terms or may not be available to us due to the impacts of COVID-19. We\nexpect that the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our liquidity position and could limit our\nability to grow our business and fully execute our business strategy. We seek to preserve and build our liquidity to best\nposition us to weather near-term market uncertainty, satisfy our loan future funding requests and to potentially make new\ninvestments, which will cause us to take some or all of the following actions: borrow additional capital, sell assets and /or\nchange our dividend distributions consistent with REIT distribution requirements.\n\u2022 Interest rates and credit spreads have been significantly impacted since the outbreak of COVID-19. This can result in\nvolatile changes to the fair value of our floating rate loans, fixed-rate loans and CRE securities and also the interest\nobligations on our floating-rate borrowings, which could result in an increase to our interest expense.\nWe also have experienced and may continue to experience other negative impacts to our business as a result of the pandemic\nthat could exacerbate other risks, including:\n\u2022 lack of liquidity in our assets;\n\u2022 greater risk of loss on our mezzanine loans;\n\u2022 risk associated with loans that are in transition;\n\u2022 the concentration of our loans and investments in certain geographies, property types or relationships in areas",

    "text": "The rapid development of the pandemic and the resulting economic effects have created uncertainty surrounding the ultimate\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy generally, and the CRE business in particular. As a result, we cannot project\nthe ultimate adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy or our business, including our financial condition and\nperformance. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 will depend on future developments, including new information that may emerge\nabout the severity of the pandemic, the timing, scope and effectiveness of additional governmental responses to the pandemic, including\nthe potential re-imposition of quarantines, states of emergencies, restrictions on travel and stay-at-home orders and the ensuing reactions\nby consumers, companies, governmental entities and global markets.\nA prolonged economic slowdown or lengthy or severe recession causing declining real estate values could impair our investments\nand harm our operations.\nWe believe the risks associated with our business will be more severe during periods of economic slowdown or recession if\nthese periods are accompanied by declining real estate values. Declining real estate values will likely reduce the level of new mortgage\nloan originations and other real estate-related investment activities since borrowers often use the appreciation in their existing real estate\nholdings or the expected appreciation in value-add projects to support the purchase of or incremental investment in additional properties.\nFurther, declining real estate values significantly increase the likelihood that we will incur losses on our loans in the event of default\nbecause the value of our collateral may be insufficient to cover our investment in the loan. Any sustained period of increased payment\ndelinquencies, foreclosures or losses could adversely affect our ability to invest in, sell or securitize loans, which could materially and\nadversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and our ability to pay distributions.\nRisks Related to Our Financing\nOur portfolio has been financed in material part through the use of leverage that may reduce the return on our investments and cash\navailable for distribution.\nOur portfolio has been financed in material part through the use of leverage and, as credit market conditions permit, we will\nseek such financing in the future. Using leverage subjects us to risks associated with debt financing, including the risks that:\n\u2022 the cash provided by our operating activities will not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest,\n\u2022 the cost of financing may increase relative to the income from the assets financed, reducing the income we have available\nto pay distributions, and\n\u2022 our investments may have maturities that differ from the maturities of the related financing and, consequently, the risk that\nthe terms of any refinancing we obtain will not be as favorable as the terms of existing financing.\nIf we are unable to secure refinancing of our currently outstanding financing, when due, on acceptable terms, we may be forced\nto dispose of some of our assets at disadvantageous terms or to obtain financing at unfavorable terms, either of which may result in\nlosses to us or reduce the cash flow available to meet our debt service obligations or to pay distributions.\nFinancing that we may obtain and financing we have obtained through CRE debt securitizations typically require, or will\nrequire, us to maintain a specified ratio of the amount of the financing to the value of the assets financed.

Moreover, assets acquired by us pursuant to our repurchase\nagreements, warehouse facilities, senior secured financing facility or other short-term financings may not be suitable for refinancing\nthrough long-term arrangements and may require us to liquidate some or all of the related assets.\nWe have entered into repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities and senior secured financing facility and expect in the future\nto seek additional debt to finance our growth. Lenders typically have the right to liquidate assets securing or acquired under these\nfacilities upon the occurrence of specified events, such as an event of default. We are exposed to loss if the proceeds received by the\nlender upon liquidation are insufficient to satisfy our obligation to the lender. We are also subject to the risk that the assets subject to\nsuch repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities or other debt might not be suitable for long-term refinancing or securitization\ntransactions. If we are unable to refinance these assets on a long-term basis, or if long-term financing is more expensive than we\nanticipated at the time of our acquisition of the assets to be financed, we might be required to liquidate assets.\nWe will incur losses on our repurchase transactions if the counterparty to the transactions defaults on its obligation to resell the\nunderlying assets back to us at the end of the transaction term, or if the value of the underlying assets has declined as of the end of\nthe term or if we default in our obligations to purchase the assets.\nWhen engaged in repurchase transactions, we generally sell assets to the transaction counterparty and receive cash from the\ncounterparty. The counterparty must resell the assets back to us at the end of the term of the transaction. Because the cash we receive\nfrom the counterparty when we initially sell the assets is less than the market value of those assets, if the counterparty defaults on its\nobligation to resell the assets back to us we will incur a loss on the transaction. We will also incur a loss if the value of the underlying\nassets has declined as of the end of the transaction term, as we will have to repurchase the assets for their initial value but would receive\nassets worth less than that amount. If we default upon our obligation to repurchase the assets, the counterparty may liquidate them at a\nloss, which we are obligated to repay.

We believe that we will be\ntreated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the owner of the assets that are the subject of any such agreement, notwithstanding that\nwe may transfer record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the agreement. It is possible, however, that the\nInternal Revenue Service, or IRS, could assert that we did not own the assets during the term of the sale and repurchase agreement, in\nwhich case our ability to qualify as a REIT would be adversely affected. If any of our REIT qualifying assets are subject to a repurchase\nagreement and are sold by the counterparty in connection with a margin call, the loss of those assets could impair our ability to qualify\nas a REIT.

Depending on market conditions and credit availability, we intend to use CRE debt securitizations to finance our investments\nin the future. The equity interests of a CRE debt securitization are subordinate in right of payment to all other securities issued by the\nCRE debt securitization. The equity is usually entitled to all of the income generated by the CRE debt securitization after the CRE debt\nsecuritization pays all of the interest due on the debt securities and its other expenses.

Accordingly, if over-\ncollateralization tests are not met, distributions on the subordinated debt and equity we hold in these CLOs will cease, resulting in a\nsubstantial reduction in our cash flow. Other tests (based on delinquency levels, interest coverage or other criteria) may restrict our\nability to receive cash distributions from assets collateralizing the securities issued by the CRE debt securitization entity.

In addition to risks discussed above, these arrangements could expose us to other credit risks,\nincluding the following:\n\u2022 An event of default under one short-term facility may constitute a default under other credit facilities we may have,\npotentially resulting in asset sales and losses to us, as well as increasing our financing costs or reducing the amount of\ninvestable funds available to us.\n\u2022 We may be unable to acquire a sufficient amount of eligible assets to maximize the efficiency of a CRE debt securitization\nissuance, which would require us to seek other forms of term financing or liquidate the assets.

A decline in these values would reduce the book value of our assets. Moreover, if there is an indication of credit\nquality issues for a specific investment, under the current expected credit losses, or CECL, accounting guidance, we must record a\nprovision to our earnings in order to estimate expected losses.\n24",

If the market value of those assets declines, the lender may require us to post additional collateral to\nsupport the loan. If we are unable to post the additional collateral, we would have to repay some portion or all of the loan, which may\nrequire us to sell assets, which could potentially be under adverse market conditions. As a result, our earnings would be reduced or we\ncould sustain losses, and cash available to make distributions could be reduced or eliminated.\nIncreases in interest rates and other factors could reduce the value of our investments, result in reduced earnings or losses and\nreduce our ability to pay distributions.\nA significant risk associated with our investment in CRE-related loans, and, historically, our CMBS and other debt investments\nis the risk that either or both of long-term and short-term interest rates increase significantly. If long-term rates increase, the market\nvalue of our assets would decline. Even if assets underlying investments we may own in the future are guaranteed by one or more\npersons, including government or government-sponsored agencies, those guarantees do not protect against declines in market value of\nthe related assets caused by interest rate changes. At the same time, with respect to assets that are not match-funded or that have been\nacquired with variable rate or short-term financing, an increase in short-term interest rates would increase our interest expense, reducing\nour net interest spread or possibly result in negative cash flow from those assets. This could result in reduced profitability and\ndistributions or losses.\nChanges in the method for determining the benchmark rate (LIBOR or a replacement of LIBOR) may adversely affect the value of\nour loans, investments and borrowings and could affect our results of operations.\nHistorically, we have utilized LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate for the pricing of our CRE loans and have been exposed to\nLIBOR through our issuance of notes on our securitizations and the use of term facilities and repurchase agreements. In July 2017, the\nU.K. FCA announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. In March 2021, the FCA announced that it\nwould cease publication of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR immediately after December 31, 2021 and cease publication of\nthe remaining tenors immediately after June 30, 2023. Additionally, the U.S. Federal Reserve encouraged companies to cease using\nLIBOR as a benchmark rate by December 31, 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates\nCommittee, a steering committee comprising large U.S. financial institutions, has identified SOFR, a new index calculated by short-\nterm repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities, as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR.\nIn connection with such recommendations and developments, all variable rate loans originated by us beginning January 1, 2022\nhave been benchmarked to SOFR. All of our floating-rate loans contain terms that allow for the transition to alternative rates. In\nSeptember 2021 and January 2022, the term warehouse financing facilities with JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, respectively,\nwere amended to allow for the transition to alternative rates, including rates tied to SOFR, subject to benchmark transition events",

When\nLIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to amend our remaining loan and borrowing agreements that utilize LIBOR as a factor in\ndetermining the interest rate or hedge against fluctuations in LIBOR based on a new standard that is established, if any. Any resulting\ndifferences in interest rate standards among our assets and our borrowings may result in interest rate mismatches between our assets and\nthe borrowings used to fund such assets. The transition from LIBOR to SOFR or to another alternative rate may result in financial market\ndisruptions and significant increases in benchmark rates, resulting in increased financing costs to us, any of which could have an adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock.\nInvesting in mezzanine debt, preferred equity, mezzanine or other subordinated tranches of CMBS involves greater risks of loss than\nsenior secured debt investments.\nSubject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act, we may\ninvest in mezzanine debt, preferred equity and mezzanine or other subordinated tranches of CMBS. We currently have investments in\nmezzanine debt. These types of investments carry a higher degree of risk of loss than senior secured debt investments such as our whole\nloan investments because, in the event of default and foreclosure, holders of senior liens will be paid in full before mezzanine investors.\nDepending on the value of the underlying collateral at the time of foreclosure, there may not be sufficient assets to pay all or any part of\namounts owed to mezzanine investors. Moreover, mezzanine and other subordinate debt investments may have higher LTV than\nconventional senior lien financing, resulting in less equity in the collateral and increasing the risk of loss of principal.

Preferred equity investments involve\na higher degree of risk than first mortgage loans due to a variety of factors, including the risk that, similar to mezzanine loans, such\ninvestments are subordinate to first mortgage loans and are not collateralized by property underlying the investment. Unlike mezzanine\nloans, preferred equity investments generally do not have a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the\nentity owning the property. Although as a holder of preferred equity we may enhance our position with covenants that limit the activities\nof the entity in which we hold an interest and protect our equity by obtaining an exclusive right to control the underlying property after\nan event of default, should such a default occur on our investment, we would only be able to proceed against the entity in which we hold\nan interest, and not the property owned by such entity and underlying our investment. As a result, we may not recover some or all of our\ninvestment.\nWe record some of our portfolio investments, including those classified as assets held for sale, at fair value as estimated by our\nmanagement and, as a result, there will be uncertainty as to the value of these investments.\nWe currently hold, and expect that we will hold in the future, portfolio investments that are not publicly traded. The fair value\nof securities and other investments that are not publicly traded may not be readily determinable. We value these investments quarterly\nat fair value as determined under policies approved by our Board. Because such valuations are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over\nshort periods of time and may be based on estimates, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that we\nwould have obtained if a ready market for them existed. The value of our common stock will likely decrease if our determinations\nregarding the fair value of these investments are materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon their disposal.\nWe may face competition for suitable investments.\nThere are numerous REITs and other financial investors seeking to invest in the types of assets we target. This competition\nmay cause us to forgo particular investments or to accept economic terms or structural features that we would not otherwise have\naccepted, and it may cause us to seek investments outside of our currently targeted areas.

The ability of a borrower to repay a loan or make distributions secured by or\ndependent upon an income-producing property typically depends primarily upon the successful operation of the property rather than\nupon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower. If the net operating income of the property is reduced, the borrower\u2019s\nability to repay the loan or ability to make distributions may be impaired. Net operating income of an income producing property can\nbe affected by, among other things:\n\u2022 tenant mix, success of tenant businesses, tenant bankruptcies and property management decisions;\n\u2022 property location and condition;\n\u2022 competition from comparable types of properties;\n\u2022 shifts in consumer habits or adoption of telework policies;\n\u2022 changes in laws that increase operating expenses or limit rents that may be charged;\n\u2022 any need to address environmental contamination at the property;\n\u2022 the occurrence of any uninsured casualty at the property;\n\u2022 changes in national, regional or local economic conditions and/or the conditions of specific industry segments in which\nthe lessees may operate;\n\u2022 declines in regional or local real estate values;\n\u2022 declines in regional or local rental or occupancy rates;\n\u2022 increases in interest rates, real estate tax rates and other operating expenses;\n\u2022 the availability of debt or equity financing;\n\u2022 increases in costs of construction material;\n\u2022 changes in governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies, including environmental legislation and zoning laws; and\n\u2022 acts of God, terrorism, pandemic, social unrest and civil disturbances.\nWe risk loss of principal on defaulted CRE loans we hold to the extent of any deficiency between the value we can realize from\nthe sale of the collateral securing the loan upon foreclosure and the loan\u2019s principal and accrued interest. Moreover, foreclosure of a\nmortgage loan can be an expensive and lengthy process that could reduce the net amount we can realize on the foreclosed mortgage\nloan. In a bankruptcy of a mortgage loan borrower, the mortgage loan will be deemed to be secured only to the extent of the value of\nthe underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy as determined by the bankruptcy court, and the lien securing the mortgage loan will\nbe subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor-in-possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state\nlaw.\nWe may be obligated to fund a portion of the loan at one or more future dates.

We base our allowance for credit losses on historical loss experience, current portfolio and market\nconditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts for the duration of each respective loan. However, losses have in the past, and may\nin the future, exceed our current estimates, and the difference could be substantial. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes\nin economic, operating and other conditions that may be beyond our control and difficult to estimate, including changes in interest rates,\nchanges in borrowers\u2019 creditworthiness and the value of collateral securing loans. Additionally, if we seek to expand our loan portfolios,\nwe may need to make additional provisions for credit losses to ensure that the allowance remains at levels deemed appropriate by our\nmanagement for the size and quality of our portfolios. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2022 is\nadequate to cover our anticipated losses, we cannot assure you that it will not increase in the future. Any increase in our allowance for\ncredit losses will reduce our income and, if sufficiently large, could cause us to incur significant losses.\nThe CECL model may require us to increase our allowance for credit losses and therefore may have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe CECL allowance required is a valuation account that is deducted from the related loans\u2019 and debt securities\u2019 amortized\ncost basis on our consolidated balance sheets, which reduces our total stockholders\u2019 equity. Additional changes to the CECL allowance\nare recognized through net income on our consolidated statements of operations. While the guidance does not require any particular\nmethod for determining the CECL allowance, it does specify the allowance should be based on relevant information about past events,\nincluding historical loss experience, current portfolio and market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts for the duration\nof each respective loan. Because our methodology for determining CECL allowances may differ from the methodologies employed by\nother companies, our CECL allowances may not be comparable with the CECL allowances reported by other companies. In addition,\nother than pursuant to a few narrow exceptions, the guidance requires that all financial instruments subject to the CECL model have\nsome amount of reserve to reflect the GAAP principal underlying the CECL model that all loans, debt securities, and similar assets have\nsome inherent risk of loss, regardless of credit quality, subordinate capital, or other mitigating factors. Accordingly, the adoption of the\nCECL model materially affected our determination of the allowance for credit losses and required us to increase our allowance upon\nadoption and recognize provisions for credit losses earlier in the lending cycle.

For example, the rights of holders of B-\nnotes to control the process following a borrower default may be limited in certain investments. Depending upon market and economic\nconditions, we may make B-note investments at any time.

We have not established a minimum distribution payment level, and our\nability to make distributions may be impaired by the risk factors described in this report. All distributions will be made at the discretion\nof our Board and will depend on our earnings, our financial condition, maintenance of our REIT qualification and other factors as our\nBoard may deem relevant from time to time. We may not be able to make distributions in the future. In addition, some of our distributions\nmay include a return of capital. To the extent that we decide to make distributions in excess of our current and accumulated taxable\nearnings and profits, such distributions would generally be considered a return of capital for federal income tax purposes. A return of\ncapital is not taxable, but it has the effect of reducing the holder\u2019s tax basis in its investment. Although we currently do not expect that\nwe will do so, we have in the past and may in the future also use proceeds from any offering of our securities that we have not invested\nor borrowed funds to make distributions. If we use uninvested offering proceeds to pay distributions in the future, we will have less\nfunds available for investment and, as a result, our earnings and cash available for distribution would be less than we might otherwise\nhave realized had such funds been invested. Similarly, if we borrow to fund distributions, our future interest costs would increase,\nthereby reducing our future earnings and cash available for distribution from what they otherwise would have been.\nLoss of our exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act would require significant changes in our operations and\ncould reduce the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions.\nWe rely on an exclusion from registration as an investment company afforded by Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company\nAct. To qualify for this exclusion, we do not engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading securities and\nwe do not own \u201cinvestment securities\u201d with a value that exceeds 40% of the value of our total assets (exclusive of government securities\nand cash items) on an unconsolidated basis.

Under the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion, ACRES RF is required to\nmaintain, on the basis of positions taken by the SEC staff in interpretive and no-action letters, a minimum of 55% of the value of the\ntotal assets of its portfolio in Qualifying Interests and a minimum of 80% in Qualifying Interests and real estate-related assets, with the\nremainder permitted to be miscellaneous assets. Because registration as an investment company would significantly affect ACRES RF\u2019s\nability to engage in certain transactions or to organize itself in the manner it is currently organized, we intend to maintain its qualification\nfor this exclusion from registration.\nHistorically, we treat our investments in mezzanine loans and our investments in CMBS as Qualifying Interests for purposes\nof determining our eligibility for the exclusion provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) to the extent such treatment is consistent with guidance\nprovided by the SEC or its staff. In the absence of specific guidance or guidance that otherwise supports the treatment of these\ninvestments as Qualifying Interests, we will treat them, for purposes of determining our eligibility for the exclusion provided by Section\n3(c)(5)(C), as real estate-related assets or miscellaneous assets, as appropriate.\nIf ACRES RF\u2019s portfolio does not comply with the requirements of the exclusion we rely upon, it could be forced to alter its\nportfolio by selling or otherwise disposing of a substantial portion of the assets that are not Qualifying Interests or by acquiring a\nsignificant position in assets that are Qualifying Interests. Altering its portfolio in this manner may have an adverse effect on its\ninvestments if it is forced to dispose of or acquire assets in an unfavorable market, and may adversely affect our stock price.\nIf it were established that we were an unregistered investment company, there would be a risk that we would be subject to\nmonetary penalties and injunctive relief in an action brought by the SEC that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties,\nthat third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions undertaken during the period it was established that we were an\nunregistered investment company, and that we would be subject to limitations on corporate leverage that would have an adverse impact\non our investment returns.\n34",

If the decline in real estate asset values and/or income occurs quickly, this may be especially difficult to accomplish. We\nmay have to make investment decisions that we otherwise would not make absent REIT qualification and Investment Company Act\nconsiderations.\nRisks Related to Our REIT Status and Certain Other Tax Items\nComplying with REIT requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities.\nTo qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy various tests regarding the sources of our\nincome, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our common\nstock. In order to meet these tests, we may be required to forgo investments we might otherwise make. Thus, compliance with the REIT\nrequirements may hinder our investment performance.\nIn particular, at least 75% of our assets at the end of each calendar quarter must consist of real estate assets, government\nsecurities, cash and cash items. For this purpose, \u201creal estate assets\u201d generally include interests in real property, such as land, buildings,\nleasehold interests in real property, stock of other entities that qualify as REITs, interests in mortgage loans secured by real property,\ninvestments in stock or debt investments during the one-year period following the receipt of new capital and regular or residual interests\nin a real estate mortgage investment conduit (\u201cREMIC\u201d). In addition, the amount of securities of a single issuer, other than a TRS, that\nwe hold must generally not exceed either 5% of the value of our gross assets or 10% of the vote or value of such issuer\u2019s outstanding\nsecurities.\nCertain of the assets that we hold are not qualified and will not be qualified real estate assets for purposes of the REIT asset\ntests. CMBS securities should generally qualify as real estate assets. However, to the extent that we own non-REMIC collateralized\nmortgage obligations or other debt investments secured by mortgage loans (rather than by real property) or secured by non-real estate\nassets, or debt securities that are not secured by mortgages on real property, those securities are likely not qualifying real estate assets\nfor purposes of the REIT asset test, and will not produce qualifying real estate income. Further, whether securities held by warehouse\nlenders or financed using repurchase agreements are treated as qualifying assets or as generating qualifying real estate income for\npurposes of the REIT asset and income tests depends on the terms of the warehouse or repurchase financing arrangement.\nWe generally will be treated as the owner of any assets that collateralize CRE debt securitization transactions to the extent that\nwe retain all of the equity of the securitization vehicle and do not make an election to treat such securitization vehicle as a TRS, as\ndescribed in further detail below.

A TRS will pay federal, state and local income tax at regular corporate rates on\nany income that it earns, whether or not it distributes that income to us. In addition, the TRS rules limit the deductibility of interest paid\nor accrued by a TRS to its parent REIT to assure that the TRS is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT\u2019S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER\nPURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the symbol \u201cACR\u201d.\nWe are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d) which requires that we\ndistribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income. As a result of losses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 in connection\nwith the economic impact of the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic, we received significant net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d)\ncarryforwards. NOLs are able to offset future taxable income, limiting the requirement for common share distributions. We also\nrecognized net capital loss carryforwards as finalized in our 2020 tax return. During the year ended December 31, 2022, all taxable\nincome was distributed in the form of a preferred share distribution, and therefore, no common share distribution was required. As we\ncontinue to take steps necessary to stabilize our earnings available for distribution (\"EAD\"), our board of directors, (our \"Board\"), will\nestablish a plan for the prudent resumption of the payment of common share distributions. No assurance, however, can be given as to\nthe amounts or timing of future distributions as such distributions are subject to our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements\nand such other factors as our Board deems relevant.\nThe following table summarizes our current and estimated tax loss carryforwards (dollars in millions):\nTax Year\nRecognized REIT (QRS) Tax Loss Carryforwards TRS Tax Loss Carryforwards\nTax Asset Item Operating Capital Operating Capital\nNet Operating Loss\nCarryforwards:\nCumulative as of 2021 2021 Return $ 46.6 $ \u2014 $ 60.1 $ \u2014\nNet Capital Loss Carryforwards:\nCumulative as of 2021 2021 Return \u2014 121.9 \u2014 1.0\nTotal tax asset estimates $ 46.6 $ 121.9 $ 60.1 $ 1.0\nUseful life Unlimited 5 years Various 5 years\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we generated $1.1 million of taxable income which was offset by our cumulative\nNOL, leaving $46.6 million to carry forward to future years. NOL can generally be carried forward to offset both ordinary taxable\nincome and capital gains in future years. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTCJA\u201d) along with revisions made by the Coronavirus Aid,\nRelief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES\u201d) reduced the deduction for NOLs to 80% of taxable income and granted an indefinite\ncarryforward period.\nAdditionally, $15.0 million of net capital gains was reported on our tax return for the year ended December 31, 2021. This\nwas offset with our cumulative total net capital losses, leaving $121.9 million to carry forward to future years. No capital losses expired\nduring 2021.\nWe also have tax assets in our taxable REIT subsidiaries (\u201cTRS\u201d). These tax assets are analyzed and disclosed quarterly in our\nfinancial statements. As of December 31, 2022, our TRSs",

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nWe have omitted discussion of the earliest of the three years covered by our consolidated financial statements presented in this\nreport as that disclosure is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) on March 9, 2022.

Management\u2019s Discussion\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d within that report.\nOverview\nWe are a Maryland corporation and an externally managed REIT that is primarily focused on originating, holding and managing\ncommercial real estate (\u201cCRE\u201d) mortgage loans and other commercial real estate-related debt investments. On July 31, 2020, our\nmanagement contract was acquired from Exantas Capital Manager Inc., a subsidiary of C-III Capital Partners LLC, by ACRES Capital,\nLLC (our \u201cManager\u201d), a subsidiary of ACRES Capital Corp. (collectively, \u201cACRES\u201d), a private commercial real estate lender\nexclusively dedicated to nationwide middle market CRE lending with a focus on multifamily, student housing, hospitality, office and\nindustrial in top United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) markets (the \u201cACRES acquisition\u201d). Our Manager draws upon the management team of ACRES\nand its collective investment experience to provide its services. Our objective is to provide our stockholders with total returns over time,\nincluding quarterly distributions and capital appreciation, while seeking to manage the risks associated with our investment strategies\nas well as to maximize long-term stockholder value by maintaining stability through our available liquidity and diversified CRE loan\nportfolio.\nAn important aspect of the ACRES acquisition was that it delivered operational liquidity in order to mitigate additional potential\nmargin call risk as a result of the market volatility that was created by the COVID-19 pandemic (see below), which allowed us to focus\non asset management within the portfolio in efforts to restart loan originations and underwriting. Our Manager has and expects to\ncontinue to leverage the complementary nature of our lending platforms, its experience and its network of relationships to enhance our\nnew business loan pipeline. Additionally, our Manager continuously monitors for new capital opportunities and executes on agreements\nthat enhance our returns.\nIn December 2019, COVID-19 was identified. The resulting spread of COVID-19 throughout the globe led the World Health\nOrganization to designate COVID-19 as a pandemic and numerous countries, including the U.S, to declare national emergencies. Many\ncountries responded to the initial and ensuing outbreaks of COVID-19 by instituting quarantines and restrictions on travel and limiting\noperations of non-essential offices and retail centers, which resulted in the closure or remote operation of non-essential businesses,\nincreased rates of unemployment and market disruption in connection with the economic uncertainty. The aforementioned quarantines\nand travel restrictions contributed significantly to economic disruptions across the country that directly impacted our borrowers and\ntheir ability to pay and to stay current with their debt obligations in 2020",

The aforementioned quarantines\nand travel restrictions contributed significantly to economic disruptions across the country that directly impacted our borrowers and\ntheir ability to pay and to stay current with their debt obligations in 2020 and 2021, causing significant increases in our provisions for\ncredit losses. During the height of the pandemic, we used a variety of legal and structural options to manage credit risk effectively,\nincluding through forbearance and extension provisions or other agreements.\nDue in large part to the development and distribution of vaccines and other treatments, the U.S. and other countries around the\nworld have eased or removed restrictions entirely, financial markets are more liquid, collateral performance has improved and\nunemployment rates have stabilized to some degree; as such, at December 31, 2022, we have substantially reversed provisions for credit\nlosses related to macroeconomic factors impacted by COVID-19. For additional discussion with respect to the potential impact of\nCOVID-19 on our liquidity and capital resources, see \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nCurrently, domestic and global markets are grappling with managing rising inflation rates, supply chain disruptions and energy\nmarket dislocations. These additional market pressures are manifesting themselves in higher consumer prices and have led domestic and\nglobal monetary policy makers to raise historically low short-term interest rates at rates much faster than originally anticipated by\ndomestic and global financial markets in hopes of containing inflation and staving off or tempering an economic recession. The U.S.\nFederal Reserve has raised the Federal Funds rate by 4.25% in seven rate hikes between March 2022 and December 2022 to combat\ninflation, and more rate hikes are expected in the near future. These increases in the cost of capital and goods are expected to cause\nshort-term dislocations in various investment and financing markets in which we participate as we and other market participants adjust\nto the new financing environment.\nWe continuously monitor the effects of domestic and global events, including but not limited to the current and expected\nimpacts of inflation, labor shortages, supply chain matters and rising interest rates, on our operations and financial position to ensure\nthat we remain responsive and adaptable to the dynamic changes in our operating environment. However, it is inherently difficult to\naccurately assess the continuing impact of domestic or global macroeconomic events on our revenues, profitability and financial\nposition.

    "text": "While the CRE whole loans included in the CRE loan portfolio are substantially composed of floating-rate loans benchmarked\nto market rates including the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), asset\nyields are protected through the use of benchmark floors and minimum interest periods that typically range from 12 to 18 months at the\ntime of a loan\u2019s origination. Our benchmark floors provide asset yield protection when the benchmark interest rate falls below an in-\nplace benchmark floor. Our net investment returns are enhanced by a decline in the cost of our floating-rate liabilities that do not have\nbenchmark floors. Our net investment returns will be negatively impacted by the rising cost of our floating-rate liabilities that do not\nhave floors until the benchmark interest rate is above the benchmark floor, at which point our floating-rate loans and floating-rate\nliabilities will be match funded, effectively locking in our net interest margin until the benchmark floor rate is activated again or the\nfloating-rate loan is paid off or refinanced.\nIn a business environment where benchmark interest rates are increasing significantly, cash flows of the CRE assets underlying\nour loans may not be sufficient to pay debt service on our loans, which could result in non-performance or default. We partially mitigate\nthis risk by generally requiring our borrowers to purchase interest rate cap agreements with non-affiliated, well-capitalized third parties\nand by selectively requiring our borrowers to have and maintain debt service reserves. These interest rate caps generally mature prior to\nthe maturity date of the loan and the borrowers are required to pay to extend them. In most cases the sponsors will need to fund additional\nequity into the properties to cover these costs as the property may not generate sufficient cash flow to pay these costs. At December 31,\n2022, 88.8% of the par value of our CRE loan portfolio had interest rate caps in place with a weighted-average maturity of 1.1 years.\nAt December 31, 2022, our par-value $2.1 billion floating-rate CRE loan portfolio, which includes one whole loan without a\nbenchmark floor, had a weighted average benchmark floor of 0.68%. At December 31, 2021, our par-value $1.9 billion floating rate\nCRE loan portfolio, which includes one whole loan without a benchmark floor, had a weighted average benchmark floor of 0.75%. The\ndecrease in the weighted average benchmark floor was a result of older CRE floating-rate loans with higher floors paying off and being\nreplaced with newer loans with lower floors. With the trend of rising benchmark interest rates in 2022 (both LIBOR and SOFR), we\nhave seen the coupons on all of our floating-rate assets and debt rise accordingly. Because we have equity invested in each floating-rate\nloan, and because in all instances the benchmark interest rates are above our loan floors, the rise in interest rates expected by the market\nwill result in an increase in our net interest income.

The cost of borrowings to finance our investments is a significant part of our expenses.\nOur net interest income depends on our ability to control these expenses relative to our revenue. Our CRE loans may initially be financed\nwith term facilities, such as CRE loan warehouse financing facilities, in anticipation of their ultimate securitization. We ultimately seek\nto finance our CRE loans through the use of non-recourse long-term, match-funded CRE debt securitizations.\nOur asset-specific borrowings comprised CRE debt securitizations, term warehouse financing facilities and our senior secured\nfinancing facility. In May 2021, we closed ACRES Commercial Realty 2021-FL1 Issuer, Ltd. (\u201cACR 2021-FL1\u201d), a new CRE debt\nsecuritization financing $802.6 million of CRE loans with $675.2 million of non-recourse, floating-rate notes at a weighted average cost\nof one-month LIBOR plus 1.49%. Simultaneously, we executed the optional redemption on Exantas Capital Corp. 2019-RSO7, Ltd.\n(\u201cXAN 2019-RSO7\u201d) and paid off the remaining notes. In December 2021, we closed ACRES Commercial Realty 2021-FL2 Issuer,\nLtd. (\u201cACR 2021-FL2\u201d), a new CRE debt securitization financing $700.0 million of CRE loans with $567.0 million of non-recourse,\nfloating-rate notes at a weighted average cost of one-month LIBOR plus 1.80%. Each of these 2021 CLOs provides for a two-year\nreinvestment period that allows us to reinvest CRE loan payoffs and principal paydown proceeds into the securitizations, pending certain\neligibility criteria are met and rating agency approval is obtained. The reinvestment feature of the securitizations will allow us to extend\nthe securitizations\u2019 financing lives at favorable interest rates through the reinvestment of loan payoff proceeds into new loans.\nIn February 2022 and March 2022, we exercised the optional redemptions of Exantas Capital Corp. 2020-RSO8, Ltd.

In March 2021, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority\nannounced that it would cease publication of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR immediately after December 31, 2021 and\ncease publication of the remaining tenors immediately after June 30, 2023. In July 2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with\nthe Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprising large U.S. financial institutions, has identified SOFR as\nits preferred alternative rate for LIBOR.\nAll variable rate loans originated by us beginning January 1, 2022 have been benchmarked to SOFR. Additionally, all of our\nfloating-rate whole loans contain provisions that provide for the transition of the contractual benchmark interest rate to an alternative\nrate. At December 31, 2022, our loan portfolio had a carrying value of $2.0 billion of floating rate loans, 68.3% or $1.4 billion of which\nhave interest rates tied to LIBOR and 31.7% or $646.2 million of which have interest rates tied to SOFR.\nIn September 2021 and January 2022, the term warehouse financing facilities with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\u201cJPMorgan\nChase\u201d) and Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC (\u201cMorgan Stanley\u201d), respectively, were amended to allow for the\ntransition to alternative rates, including rates tied to SOFR, subject to benchmark transition events. Additionally, during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, we entered into a loan agreement to finance the acquisition of a student housing complex, which uses SOFR as its\nbenchmark interest rate. At December 31, 2022, we had $1.7 billion of floating rate borrowings, 75.8% or $1.3 billion of which have\ninterest rates tied to LIBOR and 24.2% or $419.2 million of which have interest rates tied to SOFR.\nWe expect to complete the process of converting our LIBOR-based loans and borrowings to an applicable benchmark interest\nrate during 2023.\nThe transition from LIBOR to SOFR or to another alternative rate may result in financial market disruptions and significant\nincreases in benchmark interest rates, resulting in increased financing costs to us, any of which could have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our common stock. See \u201cPart I. Item 1A.

However, the discovery and distribution of vaccines and other treatments for COVID-19 led to a\nrecovery of the global economy and markets worldwide, which resulted in a net reversal of credit losses of $21.3 million during the year\nended December 31, 2021. The ensuing macroeconomic factors, including expected increases in inflation, short-term interest rates,\nenergy prices and continued global supply chain dislocation trending negative, compounded by an increase in portfolio credit risk\nindicated in property-level cash flows that collateralize our loans, resulted in a net provision of expected credit losses of $12.3 million\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022.\nIn addition to our general estimate of credit losses, we may also be required to individually evaluate collateral-dependent loans\nfor credit losses if it has determined that foreclosure or sale of the loan or the underlying collateral is probable.

Depending on\nthe loan\u2019s performance against these various factors, loans are rated on a scale from 1 to 5, with loans rated 1 representing loans with\nthe highest credit quality and loans rated 5 representing the loans with the lowest credit quality. The factors evaluated provide general\ncriteria to monitor credit migration in our loan portfolio; as such, a loan\u2019s rating may improve or worsen, depending on new information\nreceived.\n59",

Performance criteria and loan covenants\nhave required occasional waivers.\n\u2022 Occupancy is not stabilized and the property has a large amount of tenancy rollover.\n5 \u2022 Property performance is significantly worse than underwritten expectations. The loan is not in compliance with loan\ncovenants and performance criteria and may be in default. Expected sale proceeds would not be sufficient to pay off\nthe loan at maturity.\n\u2022 The property has a material vacancy rate and significant rollover of remaining tenants.\n\u2022 An updated appraisal is required upon designation and updated on an as-needed basis.\nAll CRE loans are evaluated for any credit deterioration by debt asset management and certain finance personnel on at least a\nquarterly basis. Historically, mezzanine loans and preferred equity investments may have experienced greater credit risks due to their\nnature as subordinated investments.\nFor the purpose of calculating the quarterly provision for credit losses under CECL, we pool CRE loans based on the underlying\ncollateral property type and utilize a probability of default and loss given default methodology for approximately one year after which\nwe immediately revert to a historical mean loss ratio. In order to calculate the historical mean loss ratio, we utilize our full, 16 year\nunderwriting history in the determination of historical losses, along with the market loss history from a selected population from an\nengaged third-party provider\u2019s database that were similar to our loan types, loan sizes, durations, interest rate structure and general LTV\nprofiles.\nCredit risk profiles of CRE loans, at amortized cost, were as follows (in thousands, except amounts in the footnote):\nRating 1 Rating 2 Rating 3 Rating 4 Rating 5 Total (1)\nAt December 31, 2022:\nWhole loans, floating-rate $ \u2014 $ 1,635,376 309,491 $ 85,226 $ 22,797 $ 2,052,890\nMezzanine loan \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 4,700 4,700\nTotal $ \u2014 $ 1,635,376 $ 309,491 $ 85,226 $ 27,497 $ 2,057,590\nAt December 31, 2021:\nWhole loans, floating-rate $ \u2014 $ 1,456,330 $ 273,078 $ 123,762 $ 24,681 $ 1,877,851\nMezzanine loan \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 4,700 \u2014 4,700\nTotal $ \u2014 $ 1,456,330 $ 273,078 $ 128,462 $ 24,681 $ 1,882,551\n(1) The total amortized cost of CRE loans excluded accrued",

We sought\nto mitigate the potential impact on net income (loss) of adverse fluctuations in interest rates incurred on our borrowings by entering into\nhedging agreements. We classified our interest rate hedges as cash flow hedges, which are hedges that eliminate the risk of changes in\nthe cash flows of a financial asset or liability.\nWe terminated all of our interest rate swap positions associated with our prior financed CMBS portfolio in April 2020. At\ntermination, we realized a loss of $11.8 million. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had losses of $6.6 million and $8.5 million,\nrespectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which will be amortized into earnings over the remaining life of the\ndebt. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded amortization expense, reported in interest expense on the\nconsolidated statements of operations, of $1.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had unrealized gains of $256,000 and $347,000, respectively, attributable to two\nterminated interest rate swaps, in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets, to be accreted into earnings\nover the remaining life of the debt.

    "text": "We utilize a variety of financing arrangements to finance certain assets. We generally utilize the following five types of\nfinancing arrangements:\n1. Senior Secured Financing Facility: Our senior secured financing facility allows us to borrow against loans and real estate\ninvestments that we own. This facility has an individual floating rate loan series structure that have a three month\ncommitment period after the financing is approved by the lender, subject to the maximum dollar amount agreed upon for\nthe series. Each floating rate loan series will have mutually agreed upon terms including (i) total commitment, including\nthe capacity to fund future funding commitments, where applicable; (ii) advance rate on portfolio assets; (iii) interest rate\ncomposed of one-month Term SOFR plus a market rate spread; and (iv) maturity date of five years from the issuance date\nfor the loan series unless an additional time is mutually agreed upon by the parties. The facility has a maximum portfolio\nLTV of 85% and contains customary events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods,\ncustomary for this type of financing arrangement.\n2. Term Warehouse Financing Facilities (CRE loans): Term warehouse financing facilities effectively allow us to borrow\nagainst loans that we own. Under these agreements, we transfer loans to a counterparty and agree to purchase the same\nloans from the counterparty at a price equal to the transfer price plus interest. The counterparty retains the sole discretion\nover both whether to purchase the loan from us and, subject to certain conditions, the collateral value of such loan for\npurposes of determining whether we are required to pay margin to the counterparty. Generally, if the lender determines\n(subject to certain conditions) that the value of the collateral in a repurchase transaction has decreased by more than a\ndefined minimum amount, we would be required to repay any amounts borrowed in excess of the product of (i) the revised\ncollateral or market value multiplied by (ii) the applicable advance rate. During the term of these agreements, we receive\nthe principal and interest on the related loans and pay interest to the counterparty.\n3. Securitizations: We seek non-recourse long-term financing from securitizations of our investments in CRE loans. The\nsecuritizations generally involve a senior portion of our loan but may involve the entire loan. Securitization generally\ninvolves transferring notes to a special purpose vehicle (or the issuing entity), which then issues one or more classes of\nnon-recourse notes pursuant to the terms of an indenture. The notes are secured by the pool of assets. In exchange for the\ntransfer of assets to the issuing entity, we receive cash proceeds from the sale of non-recourse notes. Securitizations of our\nportfolio investments might magnify our exposure to losses on those portfolio investments because the retained subordinate\ninterest in any particular overall loan would be subordinate to the loan components sold and we would, therefore, absorb\nall losses sustained with respect to the overall loan before the owners of the senior notes experience any losses with respect\nto the loan in question.\n4. Mortgage payable: We have entered into a loan agreement to finance the acquisition of a student housing complex. This\nloan is interest only and has a maximum principal balance, most of which was advanced in the initial funding. The loan\nagreement contains events of default, subject to certain materiality thresholds and grace periods, customary for this type",

The remedies\nfor such events of default are also customary for this type of transaction. Additionally, we have entered into a financing\nagreement to fund energy efficient building improvements at this student housing complex, with a maximum principal\nbalance of $15.5 million.\nThe issuances of ACR 2021-FL1 and ACR 2021-FL2 include 24-month reinvestment periods ending in May 2023 and\nDecember 2023, respectively, that allow us to reinvest CRE loan payoffs and paydowns into the securitizations upon the satisfaction of\ncertain eligibility and reinvestment criteria along with rating agency approval. The reinvestment feature of the securitizations will allow\nus to extend the securitizations\u2019 financing capability by increasing the useful lives of the senior notes through the reinvestment of loan\nproceeds into new loans. We are also able to acquire future funding participations of the collateral in the securitizations during the\nreinvestment period.\nWe were in compliance with all of our covenants at December 31, 2022 in accordance with the terms provided in agreements\nwith our lenders.\nWe are continuing to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on us, the borrowers underlying our commercial real\nestate-related loans (and their tenants), our financing sources, and the economy as a whole. Because the severity, magnitude and duration\nof the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict, the pandemic\u2019s\nimpact on our operations and liquidity remains uncertain and difficult to predict.

Preferred equity investments had $2.5 million in unfunded\ninvestment commitments at December 31, 2020. The preferred equity investments paid off during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nUnfunded commitments are not considered in the CECL reserve if they are unconditionally cancellable.\nGuarantees and Indemnifications\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may provide guarantees and indemnifications that contingently obligate us to make\npayments to the guaranteed or indemnified party based on changes in the value of an asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed\nor indemnified party. As such, we may be obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party based on another entity\u2019s failure to perform\nor achieve specified performance criteria, or we may have an indirect guarantee of the indebtedness of others.\nAs part of our May 2017 sale of our equity interest in Pearlmark Mezz, we entered into an indemnification agreement whereby\nwe indemnified the purchaser against realized losses of up to $4.3 million on one mezzanine loan until its final maturity date in 2020.\nAs a result of the indemnified party\u2019s partial sale of the mezzanine loan, our maximum exposure was reduced to $536,000 in 2019. In\nOctober 2020, the mezzanine loan paid off its balance to the indemnified party, resulting in the extinguishment of our liability.\nIn January 2023, Chapel Drive East, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the FSU Student Venture, entered into a loan\nagreement (the \"Construction Loan Agreement\") with Oceanview Life and Annuity Company (\"Oceanview\") to finance the construction\nof a student housing complex (the \"Construction Loan\").\nIn connection with our investment in the student housing complex, ACRES RF entered into guarantees related to the\nConstruction Loan.

The preparation of financial\nstatements in conformity with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities\nand disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements, and our financial results. We believe that certain\nof our policies are critical because they require us to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently\nuncertain. The critical policies summarized below relate to valuation of investment securities, accounting for derivative financial\ninstruments and hedging activities, income taxes, allowance for credit losses and variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d). We have reviewed\nthese accounting policies with our Board and believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our financial statements are\nbased were reasonable at the time made based upon information available to us at the time.\n77",

    "text": "Allowance for Credit Losses\nWe maintain an allowance for credit loss on our loans held for investment. CRE loans that are held for investment are carried\nat cost, net of unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts, loan fees and origination costs as applicable. Effective January 1, 2020,\nwe determine our allowance for credit losses, consistent with GAAP, by measuring CECL on the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis. We\nutilize a probability of default and loss given default methodology over a reasonable and supportable forecast period after which we\nrevert to the historical mean loss ratio, utilizing a blended approach sourced from our own historical losses and the market losses from\nan engaged third party\u2019s database, to be applied for the remaining estimable period. The CECL model requires us to make significant\njudgments, including: (i) the selection of a reasonable and supportable forecast period, (ii) the selection and weighting of appropriate\nmacroeconomic forecast scenarios, (iii) projections for the amounts and timing of future fundings of committed balances and\nprepayments on CRE investments, (iv) the determination of the risk characteristics in which to pool financial assets, and (v) the\nappropriate historical loss data to use in the model. Unfunded commitments are not considered in the CECL reserve if they are\nunconditionally cancellable by us.\nWe measure the loan portfolio\u2019s credit losses by grouping loans based on similar risk characteristics under CECL, which is\ntypically based on the loan\u2019s collateral type. We regularly evaluate the risk characteristics of our loan portfolio to determine whether a\ndifferent pooling methodology is more accurate. Further, if we determine that foreclosure of a loan\u2019s collateral is probable or repayment\nof the loan is expected through sale or operation of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, expected credit\nlosses are measured as the difference between the current fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost of the loan. Fair value may\nbe determined based on (i) the present value of estimated cash flows; (ii) the market price, if available; or (iii) the fair value of the\ncollateral less estimated disposition costs.\nWhile a loan exhibiting credit quality deterioration may remain on accrual status, the loan is placed on non-accrual status at\nsuch time as (i) management believes that scheduled debt service payments will not be met within the coming 12 months; (ii) the loan\nbecomes 90 days past due; (iii) management determines the borrower is incapable of, or has ceased efforts toward, curing the cause of\nthe credit deterioration; or (iv) the net realizable value of the loan\u2019s underlying collateral approximates our carrying value for such loan.\nWhile on non-accrual status, we recognize interest income only when an actual payment is received if a credit analysis supports the\nborrower\u2019s principal repayment capacity. When a loan is placed on non-accrual, previously accrued interest is reversed from interest\nincome.\nWe utilize the contractual life of our loans to estimate the period over which we measure expected credit losses. Estimates for\nprepayments and extensions are incorporated into the inputs for our CECL model. Modifications to loan terms, such as a modification\nin connection with a TDR, where a concession is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, may result in the extension of\nthe loan\u2019s life and an increase in the allowance for credit",

Modifications to loan terms, such as a modification\nin connection with a TDR, where a concession is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, may result in the extension of\nthe loan\u2019s life and an increase in the allowance for credit losses. In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d)\nconcurred with a joint statement of federal and state banking regulators that eased the requirements to classify a modification as a TDR\nif the modification was granted in connection with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The measurement of the impact of TDRs on\nthe expected credit losses occurs when a TDR is reasonably expected. If the concession granted on a TDR can only be captured through\na discounted cash flow analysis, then we will individually assess the loan for expected credit losses using the discounted cash flow\nmethod.\nIn order to calculate the historical mean loss ratio applied to the loan portfolio, we utilize historical losses from our full\nunderwriting history, along with the market loss history of a selected population of loans from a third party\u2019s database that are similar\nto our loan types, loan sizes, durations, interest rate structure and general LTV profiles. We may make adjustments to the historical loss\nhistory for qualitative or environmental factors if we believe there is evidence that the estimate for expected credit losses should be\nincreased or decreased.\nWe record write-offs against the allowance for credit losses if we deem that all or a portion of a loan\u2019s balance is uncollectible.\nIf we receive cash in excess of some or all of the amounts we previously wrote off, we record a recovery to increase the allowance for\ncredit losses.\nAs part of the evaluation of the loan portfolio, we assess the performance of each loan and assign a risk rating based on the\ncollective evaluation of several factors, including but not limited to: collateral performance relative to underwritten plan, time since\norigination, current implied and/or re-underwritten LTV ratios, risk inherent in the loan structure and exit plan. Loans are rated \u201c1\u201d\nthrough \u201c5,\u201d from least risk to greatest risk, in connection with this review.\nPrior to the implementation of CECL, we calculated our allowance for credit losses through the calculation of general and\nspecific reserves. The general reserve, established for loans not determined to be impaired individually, was based on our loan risk\nratings. We recorded a general reserve equal to 1.5% of the aggregate face values of loans with a risk rating of \u201c3,\u201d plus 5.0% of the\naggregate face values of loans with a risk rating of \u201c4.\u201d Loans with a risk rating of \u201c5\u201d were individually measured for impairment to be\nincluded in a specific reserve on a quarterly basis.\n78",

Acquired investments in real estate assets are recorded initially\nat fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We allocate the purchase price of our acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on the\nrelative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nWe evaluate whether property obtained as a result of our lending activities should be identified as held for sale. If a property is\ndetermined to be held for sale, all of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities will be recorded in property held for sale on the\nconsolidated balance sheets and recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Once a property is classified as held for sale, depreciation\nexpense is no longer recorded.\nInvestments in real estate are carried net of accumulated depreciation. We depreciate real property, building and tenant\nimprovements and furniture, fixtures, and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We\namortize any acquired intangible assets using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets. We\namortize the value allocated to lease right of use assets and related in-place lease liabilities, when determined to be operating leases,\nusing the straight-line method over the remaining lease term. The value allocated to any associated above or below market lease\nintangible asset or liability is amortized to lease expense over the remaining lease term.\nOrdinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into income using the effective yield method. If a loan\nwith a premium or discount is prepaid, we immediately recognize the unamortized portion as a decrease or increase to interest income.\nIn addition, we defer loan origination and extension fees and loan origination costs and recognize them over the life of the related loan\nwith interest income using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective yield method. Income recognition is suspended\nfor loans at the earlier of the date at which payments become 90 days past due or when, in our opinion, a full recovery of principal and\nincome becomes doubtful. When the ultimate collectability of the principal is in doubt, all payments received are applied to principal\nunder the cost recovery method.

The following provides additional\ndetail on room revenue and other operating revenue:\n\u2022 Room revenue is recognized when our hotel satisfies its performance obligation of providing a hotel room.

Payment is due at the time that goods or services are rendered or billed.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe consolidate entities that are VIEs where we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of such entities. Once it\nis determined that we hold a variable interest in a VIE, management performs a qualitative analysis to determine (i) if we have the power\nto direct the matters that most significantly impact the VIE\u2019s financial performance; and (ii) if we have the obligation to absorb the\nlosses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive the benefits of the VIE that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIE. If our variable interest possesses both of these characteristics, we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and\nwould be required to consolidate the VIE. This assessment must be done on an ongoing basis.\nAt December 31, 2022, we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of five VIEs that are consolidated.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Standards Adopted in 2022\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued guidance that removes certain separation models\nfor convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock that require the separation into a debt component and an equity or\nderivative component. Consequently, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized\ncost, if no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives and the convertible instrument is not issued with substantial\npremiums accounted for as paid-in capital. By removing those separation models, the interest rate of convertible debt instruments\ntypically will be closer to the coupon interest rate. The guidance also revises the derivative scope exception for contracts in an entity\u2019s\nown equity and improves the consistency of EPS calculations. Adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nAccounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Periods\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued an amendment eliminating certain previously issued accounting guidance for troubled debt\nrestructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d) and enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding refinancings, restructurings, and write-offs. Current GAAP\nprovides an exception to general recognition and measurement guidance for loan restructurings if they meet specific criteria to be\nconsidered TDRs.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAt December 31, 2022, the primary components of our market risk were credit risk, counterparty risk, financing risk and interest\nrate risk, as described below. While we do not seek to avoid risk completely, we do seek to assume risk that can be quantified from\nhistorical experience, to actively manage that risk, to earn sufficient compensation to justify assuming that risk and to maintain capital\nlevels consistent with the risk we undertake or to which we are exposed.\nCredit Risks\nOur loans and investments are subject to credit risk. The performance and value of our loans and investments depend upon the\nsponsors\u2019 ability to operate the properties that serve as our collateral so that they produce cash flows adequate to pay interest and\nprincipal due to us. To monitor this risk, ACRES Capital, LLC\u2019s asset management team reviews our investment portfolios and in certain\ninstances is in regular contact with our borrowers, monitoring performance of the collateral and enforcing our rights as necessary.\nIn addition, we are exposed to the risks generally associated with the commercial real estate (\u201cCRE\u201d) market, including\nvariances in occupancy rates, capitalization rates, absorption rates, and other macroeconomic factors beyond our control. We seek to\nmanage these risks through our underwriting and asset management processes.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the CRE markets as numerous state, local, and federal regulations were issued\nthat imposed restrictions on travel and economic activity to contain the spread of the contagion, causing reduced occupancy, requests\nfrom tenants for rent deferral or abatement, and delays in construction and development projects. While many of these restrictions have\nbeen lifted, the reduced economic activity experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic could still severely impact borrowers\u2019\nbusinesses, financial condition and liquidity and may result in borrowers being unwilling or unable to meet their obligations to us in part\nor in full.\nIn a business environment where benchmark interest rates are increasing significantly, cash flows of the CRE assets underlying\nour loans may not be sufficient to pay debt service on our loans, which could result in non-performance or default. We partially mitigate\nthis risk by generally requiring our borrowers to purchase interest rate cap agreements with non-affiliated, well-capitalized third parties\nand by selectively requiring our borrowers to have and maintain debt service reserves. These interest rate caps generally mature prior to\nthe maturity date of the loan and the borrowers are required to pay to extend them. In most cases the sponsors will need to fund additional\nequity into the properties to cover these costs as the property may not generate sufficient cash flow to pay these costs. At December 31,\n2022, 88.8% of par value of our CRE loan portfolio had interest rate caps in place with a weighted-average maturity of 1.1 years.\nThese macroeconomic conditions may persist into the future and impair our borrowers\u2019 ability to comply with the terms under\nour loan agreements. We maintain a robust asset management relationship with our borrowers and have utilized these relationships",

We maintain a robust asset management relationship with our borrowers and have utilized these relationships to\naddress the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, rising interest rates and other macroeconomic factors on our loans secured\nby properties experiencing cash flow pressure. While we believe the principal amounts of our loans are generally adequately protected\nby underlying collateral value, there is a risk that we will not realize the entire principal value of certain investments. In order to mitigate\nthat risk, we have proactively engaged with our borrowers, particularly with those with near-term maturities, in order to maximize\nrecovery.\nCounterparty Risk\nThe nature of our business requires us to hold our cash and cash equivalents and obtain financing from with various financial\ninstitutions. This exposes us to the risk that these financial institutions may not fulfill their obligations to us under these various\ncontractual arrangements. We mitigate this exposure by depositing our cash and cash equivalents and entering into financing agreements\nwith high credit-quality institutions.\nFinancing Risk\nWe finance our target assets using our CRE debt securitizations, a senior secured financing facility and warehouse financing\nfacilities.

(a Maryland corporation) and\nsubsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive\nincome (loss), changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related\nnotes and financial statement schedules included under Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d). In our opinion,\nthe financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nand the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d),\nthe Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal\nControl\u2014Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d), and\nour report dated March 7, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\nCompany\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to\nbe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error\nor fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding\nthe amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that\nour audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical audit matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material\nto the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the\ncritical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating\nthe critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they\nrelate.\nAllowance for credit losses on CRE whole loans\nAs described",

The Company measures lifetime expected credit losses on CRE whole loans on\na pooled basis, based on shared risk characteristics or individually for collateral-dependent loans. To estimate the allowance for credit\nlosses on pooled CRE whole loans, the Company utilizes a probability of default times loss given default methodology, which\nincorporates individual loan characteristics, historical loss experience and the weighting of forecasted economic scenarios. For loans\ndetermined to be collateral-dependent that are individually evaluated, the reserve is calculated based on the difference between the\ncurrent fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost of the loan. We identified the allowance for credit losses as a critical audit\nmatter.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that the allowance for credit losses is a critical audit matter are that management is\nrequired to make significant judgments in determining the accuracy of loan level data input into the estimate, the weighing of the\nforecasted economic scenarios, and in evaluating whether factors are present that indicate if an individual loan does not share risk\ncharacteristics of the pool. For loans that are determined to be collateral-dependent and individually evaluated, the assessment of fair\n84",

Evaluating these conclusions made by management required\nsignificant auditor judgment in obtaining sufficient and appropriate audit evidence related to these management determinations.\nOur audit procedures related to the allowance for credit losses included the following, among others:\n\u2022 We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the calculation of the allowance for credit losses, which\nincluded controls related to the completeness and accuracy of loan specific data used on pooled CRE whole loans,\nidentification of loans that no longer share risk characteristics of the portfolio and required individual evaluation, weighting\nof forecasted economic scenarios on pooled CRE whole loans, and for individually evaluated loans, review of the collateral\nvaluation used in determining if the amortized cost of the loan exceeds the current fair value of the collateral.\n\u2022 For a selection of pooled CRE whole loans, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of loan specific data used in the\ncalculation of the allowance for credit losses.\n\u2022 We inspected a selection of pooled CRE whole loan files to analyze the completeness of management\u2019s identification and\nevaluation of collateral dependent loans.\n\u2022 We assessed the weighting of the various economic scenarios selected by management that were applied to pooled CRE\nwhole loans by inspecting the underlying assumptions of the various scenarios and considering other relevant and reliable\nthird-party evidence.\n\u2022 For individually evaluated CRE whole loans, with the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness\nof the valuation methodology and significant assumptions made to value the collateral, to determine if the amortized cost\nexceeds current fair value of the collateral, thereby necessitating an allowance for credit loss.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2005.\nSan Francisco, California\nMarch 7, 2023\n85",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2022\nNOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION\nACRES Commercial Realty Corp., a Maryland corporation, along with its subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cCompany\u201d), is a\nREIT that is primarily focused on originating, holding and managing commercial real estate (\u201cCRE\u201d) mortgage loans and equity\ninvestments in commercial real estate properties through direct ownership and joint ventures. On July 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s\nmanagement contract was acquired from Exantas Capital Manager Inc. (the \u201cPrior Manager\u201d), a subsidiary of C-III Capital Partners\nLLC (\u201cC-III\u201d), by ACRES Capital, LLC (the \u201cManager\u201d), a subsidiary of ACRES Capital Corp. (collectively, \u201cACRES\u201d), a private\ncommercial real estate lender exclusively dedicated to nationwide middle market CRE lending with a focus on multifamily, student\nhousing, hospitality, office and industrial property in top United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) markets (the \u201cACRES acquisition\u201d).\nThe Company has qualified, and expects to qualify in the current fiscal year, as a REIT.\nThe Company conducts its operations through the use of subsidiaries that it consolidates into its financial statements. The\nCompany\u2019s core assets are consolidated through its investment in ACRES Realty Funding, Inc. (\u201cACRES RF\u201d), a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary that holds CRE loans, CRE-related securities and investments in CRE securitizations, which are consolidated as VIEs as\ndiscussed in Note 3, and special purpose entities.\nReverse Stock Split\nEffective February 16, 2021, the Company completed a one-for-three reverse stock split of its outstanding common stock. The\naccompanying financial statements and notes to the financial statements give retroactive effect to the reverse stock split for all periods\npresented. In addition, the Company adopted articles of amendment to its charter, which provided that the par value of the Company\u2019s\ncommon stock remained $0.001 immediately after effect was given for the reverse stock split. No fractional shares were issued in\nconnection with the reverse stock split. Stockholders who otherwise held fractional shares of the Company\u2019s common stock as a result\nof the reverse stock split received a cash payment in lieu of such fractional shares.\nIn May 2021, the Company adopted articles of amendment to its charter to decrease its authorized shares of capital stock from\n225,000,000 shares, consisting of 125,000,000 shares of common stock and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock to 141,666,666 shares\nconsisting of 41,666,666 shares of common stock and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock.\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the U.S. (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, majority-owned or\ncontrolled subsidiaries and VIEs for which the Company is considered the primary beneficiary.

A VIE\nis required to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party that (a) has the power to control the activities that\nmost significantly impact the VIE\u2019s economic performance and (b) has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially\nbe significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nThe Company considers the following criteria in determining whether an entity is a VIE:\n1. The equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated\nfinancial support provided by any parties, including the equity holders.\n2. The equity investors lack one or more of the following essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest.\na. The direct ability to make decisions about the entity\u2019s activities through voting rights or similar rights.\nb. The obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity.\n95",

The right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity. The equity investors have voting rights that are not\nproportionate to their economic interests, and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an\ninvestor with a disproportionately small voting interest.\nIn determining whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Company reviews governing contracts, formation\ndocuments and any other contractual arrangements for any relevant terms and determines the activities that have the most significant\nimpact on the VIE and who has the power to direct those activities. The Company also looks for kick-out rights, protective rights and\nparticipating rights as well as any financial or other support provided to the VIE and the reason for that support, and the terms of any\nexplicit or implicit arrangements that may require the Company to provide future support. The Company then makes a determination\nbased on its power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and/or a financial interest that is potentially significant. In instances\nwhen a VIE is owned by both the Company and related parties, the Company considers whether there is a single party in the related\nparty group that meets both the power and losses or benefits criteria on its own as though no related party relationship existed. If one\nparty within the related party group meets both these criteria, such reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of the VIE and no further\nanalysis is needed. If no party within the related party group on its own meets both the power and losses or benefits criteria, but the\nrelated party group as a whole meets these two criteria, the determination of primary beneficiary within the related party group is based\nupon an analysis of the facts and circumstances with the objective of determining which party is most closely associated with the VIE.\nDetermining the primary beneficiary requires significant judgment. The Company continuously analyzes entities in which it holds\nvariable interests, including when there is a reconsideration event, to determine whether such entities are VIEs and whether such potential\nVIEs should be consolidated or deconsolidated.\nVoting Interest Entities\nA voting interest entity is an entity in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable it to finance its activities\nindependently and the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic\nperformance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The usual condition\nfor a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. If the Company has a majority\nvoting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity will generally be consolidated. The Company does not consolidate a voting interest\nentity if there are substantive participating rights by other parties and/or kick-out rights by a single party or through a simple majority\nvote.\nThe Company performs on-going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the voting interest framework\nhave become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the",

Under the cost method, the Company records dividend\nincome when declared to the extent it is not considered a return of capital, which is recorded as a reduction of the cost of the investment.\nLoans\nThe Company acquires loans through direct origination and occasionally through purchases from third-parties and had\nhistorically acquired corporate leveraged loans in the secondary market and through syndications of newly originated loans. Loans are\nheld for investment; therefore, the Company initially records loans at the amount funded for originated loans or at the acquisition price\nfor loans purchased, and subsequently, accounts for them based on their outstanding principal plus or minus unamortized premiums or\ndiscounts. The Company may sell a loan held for investment where the credit fundamentals underlying a particular loan have changed\nin such a manner that the Company\u2019s expected return on investment may decrease. Once the determination has been made by the\nCompany that it no longer will hold the loan for investment, the Company identifies these loans as loans held for sale. Any credit-related\nwrite-off considerations prior to the transfer of the loan to loans held for sale are accounted for through the allowance for credit losses\non the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company reports its loans held for sale at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. To determine fair value, the Company\nprimarily uses appraisals of underlying collateral obtained from third-parties as a practical expedient. Key assumptions used in those\nappraisals are reviewed by the Company. If there is a material difference between the value provided by the appraiser and information\nused by the Company to validate the appraisal, the Company will evaluate the difference with the appraiser, which could result in an\nupdated appraisal. The Company may also use the present value of estimated cash flows, market price, if available, or other determinants\nof the fair value of the collateral less estimated disposition costs. Any determined changes in the fair value of loans held for sale are\nrecorded in fair value adjustments on financial assets held for sale on the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations. Based on a\nprioritization of inputs used in the valuation of each position, the Company categorizes these investments as either Level 2 or Level 3\nin the fair value hierarchy.\nLoan Interest Income Recognition\nInterest income on loans includes interest at stated rates adjusted for amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts based\non the contractual payment terms of the loan.

Based on a\nprioritization of inputs used in the valuation of each position, the Company categorizes these investments as either Level 2 or Level 3\nin the fair value hierarchy.\nLoan Interest Income Recognition\nInterest income on loans includes interest at stated rates adjusted for amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts based\non the contractual payment terms of the loan. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into income using the effective yield\nmethod. If a loan with a premium or discount is prepaid, the Company immediately recognizes the unamortized portion as a decrease or\nincrease to interest income. In addition, the Company defers loan origination and extension fees and loan origination costs and recognizes\nthem over the life of the related loan against interest income using the straight line method, which approximates the effective yield\nmethod. Income recognition is suspended for loans at the earlier of the date at which payments become 90 days past due or when, in the\nopinion of management, a full recovery of principal and income becomes doubtful. When the ultimate collectability of the principal is\nin doubt, all payments received are applied to principal under the cost recovery method. On the other hand, when the ultimate\ncollectability of the principal is not in doubt, contractual interest is recorded as interest income when received, under the cash method,\nuntil an accrual is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed. A loan is\nwritten off when it is no longer realizable and/or legally discharged.\nThe Company records interest receivable on its loans in accrued interest receivable on its consolidated balance sheets. The\nCompany analyzes the interest receivable balances on a timely basis, or at least quarterly, to determine if they are uncollectible. If an\ninterest receivable amount is deemed uncollectible, then the Company writes off that uncollectible amount of the interest receivable\nthrough a reversal of interest income.\n97",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nDECEMBER 31, 2022\nPreferred Equity Investment\nHistorically, the Company invested in preferred equity investments. Preferred equity investments, which are subordinate to any\nloans but senior to common equity, depending on the investment\u2019s characteristics, could be accounted for as real estate, joint ventures\nor as mortgage loans. The Company\u2019s preferred equity investments were accounted for as CRE loans held for investment, were carried\nat cost, net of unamortized loan fees and origination costs, and were included within CRE loans on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance\nsheets. The Company accreted or amortized any discounts or premiums over the life of the related loan utilizing the effective interest\nmethod. Interest and fees were recognized as income subject to recoverability, which was substantiated by obtaining annual appraisals\non the underlying property.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit loss on its loans held for investment. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company\ndetermines its allowance for credit losses by measuring the current expected credit losses (\u201cCECL\u201d) on the loan portfolio on a quarterly\nbasis. The Company utilizes a probability of default and loss given default methodology together with collateral-specific data for each\nloan over a reasonable and supportable forecast period after which it reverts to its historical mean loss ratio, utilizing a blended approach\nsourced from its own historical losses and the market losses from an engaged third party\u2019s database, to be applied for the remaining\nestimable period. The CECL model requires the Company to make significant judgments, including: (i) the selection of a reasonable\nand supportable forecast period, (ii) the selection and weighting of appropriate macroeconomic forecast scenarios, (iii) projections for\nthe amounts and timing of future fundings of committed balances and prepayments on CRE investments, (iv) the determination of the\nrisk characteristics in which to pool financial assets, and (v) the appropriate historical loss data to use in the model. Unfunded\ncommitments are not considered in the CECL reserve if they are unconditionally cancellable by the Company.\nThe Company measures the loan portfolio\u2019s credit losses by grouping loans based on similar risk characteristics under CECL,\nwhich is typically based on the loan\u2019s collateral type. The Company regularly evaluates the risk characteristics of its loan portfolio to\ndetermine whether a different pooling methodology is more accurate. Further, if the Company determines that foreclosure of a loan\u2019s\ncollateral is probable or repayment of the loan is expected through sale or operation of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing\nfinancial difficulty, expected credit losses are measured as the difference between the current fair value of the collateral and the amortized\ncost of the loan. Fair value may be determined based on (i) the present value of estimated cash flows; (ii) the market price, if available;\nor (iii) the fair value of the collateral less estimated disposition costs.\nWhile a loan exhibiting credit quality deterioration may remain on accrual status, the loan is placed on non-accrual status at\nsuch time as (i) management believes that scheduled debt service payments will not be met within the coming 12 months; (ii) the loan\nbecomes 90 days past due; (iii)",

While on non-accrual status, the Company recognizes interest income only when an actual payment is received if a credit\nanalysis supports the borrower\u2019s principal repayment capacity. When a loan is placed on non-accrual, previously accrued and\nuncollected interest is reversed from interest income.\nThe Company utilizes the contractual life of its loans to estimate the period over which it measures expected credit losses.\nEstimates for prepayments and extensions are incorporated into the inputs for the Company\u2019s CECL model. Modifications to loan terms,\nsuch as a modification in connection with a troubled debt restructuring (\u201cTDR\u201d), where a concession is granted to a borrower\nexperiencing financial difficulty, may result in the extension of the loan\u2019s life and an increase in the allowance for credit losses. In March\n2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) concurred with a joint statement of federal and state banking regulators that\neased the requirements to classify a modification as a TDR if the modification was granted in connection with the effects of the COVID-\n19 pandemic. If the concession granted on a TDR can only be captured through a discounted cash flow analysis, then the Company will\nindividually assess the loan for expected credit losses using the discounted cash flow method.\nIn order to calculate the historical mean loss ratio applied to the loan portfolio, the Company utilizes historical losses from its\nfull underwriting history, along with the market loss history of a selected population of loans from a third party\u2019s database that are\nsimilar to the Company\u2019s loan types, loan sizes, durations, interest rate structure and general loan-to-collateral value (\u201cLTV\u201d) profiles.\nThe Company may make adjustments to the historical loss history for qualitative or environmental factors if it believes there is evidence\nthat the estimate for expected credit losses should be increased or decreased.\nThe Company records write-offs against the allowance for credit losses if it deems that all or a portion of a loan\u2019s balance is\nuncollectible. If the Company receives cash in excess of some or all of the amounts it previously wrote off, it records the recovery by\nincreasing the allowance for credit losses.\n98",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nDECEMBER 31, 2022\nAs part of the evaluation of the loan portfolio, the Company assesses the performance of each loan and assigns a risk rating\nbased on the collective evaluation of several factors, including but not limited to: collateral performance relative to underwritten plan,\ntime since origination, current implied and/or re-underwritten LTV ratios, risk inherent in the loan structure and exit plan. Loans are\nrated \u201c1\u201d through \u201c5,\u201d from the least risk to the greatest risk, in connection with this review.\nPrior to the implementation of CECL, the Company calculated its allowance for credit losses through the calculation of general\nand specific reserves. The general reserve, established for loans not determined to be impaired individually, was based on the Company\u2019s\nloan risk ratings. The Company recorded a general reserve equal to 1.5% of the aggregate face values of loans with a risk rating of \u201c3,\u201d\nplus 5.0% of the aggregate face values of loans with a risk rating of \u201c4.\u201d Loans with a risk rating of \u201c5\u201d were individually measured for\nimpairment to be included in a specific reserve on a quarterly basis.\nOperating Revenue at Properties\nThrough its investments in real estate, the Company earns revenue associated with rental operations and hotel operations, which\nare presented in real estate income on the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s rental operating revenue consists of fixed contractual base rent arising from tenant leases at the Company\u2019s\noffice and student housing properties under operating leases. Revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable\nterms of the related leases. For leases that have fixed and measurable rent escalations, the difference between such rental income earned\nand the cash rent due under the provisions of the lease is recorded in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. The Company moves\nto cash basis operating lease income recognition in the period in which collectability of all lease payments is no longer considered\nprobable. At such time, any uncollectible receivable balance will be written off.\nHotel operating revenue consists of amounts derived from hotel operations, including room sales and other hotel revenues. The\nCompany recognizes hotel operating revenue when guest rooms are occupied, services have been provided or fees have been earned.\nRevenues are recorded net of any sales, occupancy or other taxes collected from customers on behalf of third parties. The following\nprovides additional detail on room revenue and other operating revenue:\n\u2022 Room revenue is recognized when the Company\u2019s hotel satisfies its performance obligation of providing a hotel room.\nThe hotel reservation defines the terms of the agreement including an agreed-upon rate and length of stay.

Acquired investments in real estate assets are recorded\ninitially at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company allocates the purchase price of its acquired assets and assumed\nliabilities based on the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company accounts for leases that it acquires\nas operating leases.\nThe Company evaluates whether property obtained as a result of its lending activities should be identified as held for sale. If a\nproperty is determined to be held for sale, all of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities will be recorded in property held for sale on\nthe consolidation balance sheet and recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, see the \u201cAssets and Liabilities Held for Sale\u201d section\nbelow. Once a property is classified as held for sale, depreciation expense is no longer recorded.\nInvestments in real estate are carried net of accumulated depreciation.

The Company amortizes any acquired intangible assets using the straight-line method over\nthe estimated useful lives of the intangible assets. The Company amortizes the value allocated to lease right of use assets and related in-\nplace lease liabilities, when determined to be operating leases, using the straight-line method over the remaining lease term.

To maintain REIT status for federal income tax purposes, the Company is generally required to distribute\nat least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its shareholders as well as comply with certain other qualification requirements as defined\nunder the Code. As a REIT, the Company is not subject to federal corporate income tax to the extent that it distributes 100% of its REIT\ntaxable income each year.\nTaxable income, from non-REIT activities managed through the Company\u2019s taxable REIT subsidiaries (\u201cTRSs\u201d), is subject to\nfederal, state and local income taxes. The Company\u2019s TRS\u2019 income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under\nthe asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis\nand tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and liabilities and recognizes a\nvaluation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of its deferred tax assets will not be\nrealized. In evaluating the realizability of the deferred tax asset or liability, the Company will consider the expected future taxable\nincome, existing and projected book to tax differences as well as tax planning strategies. This analysis is inherently subjective, as it is\nbased on forecasted earning and business and economic activity. Changes in estimates of deferred tax asset realizability, if any, are\nincluded in income tax (expense) benefit on the consolidated statements of operations.\nIn addition, several of the Company\u2019s foreign TRSs, are organized as exempted companies incorporated with limited liability\nunder the laws of the Cayman Islands. Despite their status as TRSs, they generally will not be subject to corporate tax on their earnings\nand no provision for income taxes is required. However, because they are either controlled foreign corporations or passive foreign\ninvestment companies (in which the Company has made a Qualified Electing Fund election), the Company will generally be required\nto include its share of current taxable income from the foreign TRSs in its calculation of REIT taxable income.\nThe Company accounts for taxes assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing\ntransaction (e.g., sales, use, value added) on a net (excluded from revenue) basis.\nThe Company established a full valuation allowance against its net",

However, because they are either controlled foreign corporations or passive foreign\ninvestment companies (in which the Company has made a Qualified Electing Fund election), the Company will generally be required\nto include its share of current taxable income from the foreign TRSs in its calculation of REIT taxable income.\nThe Company accounts for taxes assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue-producing\ntransaction (e.g., sales, use, value added) on a net (excluded from revenue) basis.\nThe Company established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset that was tax effected at $21.2 million and\n$21.4 million, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as the Company believed it was more likely than not that all of the deferred\ntax assets would not be realized. This assessment was based on the Company\u2019s cumulative historical losses and uncertainties as to the\namount of taxable income that would be generated in future years in its TRSs.\nThe Company evaluates and recognizes tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon\nexamination by the appropriate taxing authority. A tax position that meets this threshold is measured as the largest amount of benefit\nthat is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nDECEMBER 31, 2022\nStock Based Compensation\nIssuances of restricted stock and options are initially measured at fair value on the grant date and expensed monthly on a\nstraight-line basis over the service period to equity compensation expense on the consolidated statements of operations, with a\ncorresponding entry to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets. In accordance with GAAP, the fair value of all\nunvested issuances of restricted stock and options is not remeasured after the initial grant date.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe Company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share (\u201cEPS\u201d). Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by\ndividing net income (loss) allocable to common shares by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period. Diluted\nEPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted\ninto common stock, where such exercise or conversion would result in a lower EPS amount.\nFair Value Measurements\nIn analyzing the fair value of its investments accounted for on a fair value basis, the Company uses the fair value hierarchy,\nwhich requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair\nvalue. The Company determines fair value based on quoted prices when available or, if quoted prices are not available, through the use\nof alternative approaches, such as discounting the expected cash flows using market interest rates commensurate with the credit quality\nand duration of the investment. The hierarchy defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets\nthat are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value inputs are observable.\nLevel 3 - Prices are determined using significant unobservable inputs. In situations where quoted prices or observable inputs\nare unavailable, for example, when there is little or no market activity for an investment at the end of the period, unobservable inputs\nmay be used.\nThe level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is based on the lowest level input\nthat is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy\nrequires significant judgment. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter; depending on various factors, it is possible\nthat an asset or liability may be classified differently from quarter to quarter. Transfers between levels are determined by the Company\nat the end of the reporting period. However, the Company expects that changes in classifications between levels will be rare.\nReference Rate Reform\nHistorically, the Company has used LIBOR as the benchmark interest rate for its floating-rate whole loans and the Company\nhas been exposed to LIBOR through its floating-rate borrowings. Many of its floating-rate whole loans, CRE securitizations and term\nwarehouse financing facilities included one-month LIBOR as the original contractual benchmark interest rate. The Company's unsecured\njunior subordinated debentures use three-month LIBOR as the contractual benchmark rate. In March 2021, the United Kingdom\u2019s,",

Many of its floating-rate whole loans, CRE securitizations and term\nwarehouse financing facilities included one-month LIBOR as the original contractual benchmark interest rate. The Company's unsecured\njunior subordinated debentures use three-month LIBOR as the contractual benchmark rate. In March 2021, the United Kingdom\u2019s, or\nU.K.\u2019s, Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) announced that it would cease publication of the one-week and the two-month USD\nLIBOR immediately after December 31, 2021, and cease publication of the remaining tenors immediately after June 30, 2023. In July\n2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprising large\nU.S. financial institutions, has identified Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR.\nAll variable rate loans originated by the Company beginning January 1, 2022 have been benchmarked to SOFR. Additionally,\nall of its floating-rate whole loans contain provisions that provide for the transition of the contractual benchmark rate to an alternative\nrate. At December 31, 2022, the Company's loan portfolio had a carrying value of $2.0 billion of floating rate loans, 68.3% or $1.4\nbillion of which have interest rates tied to LIBOR and 31.7% or $646.2 million of which have interest rates tied to SOFR.\nIn September 2021 and January 2022, the term warehouse financing facilities with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\u201cJPMorgan\nChase\u201d) and Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC (\u201cMorgan Stanley\u201d), respectively, were amended to allow for the\ntransition to alternative rates, including rates tied to SOFR, subject to benchmark transition events. Additionally, during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company entered into a loan agreement to finance the acquisition of a student housing complex, which uses\nSOFR as its benchmark interest rate. At December 31, 2022, the Company had $1.7 billion of floating rate borrowings, 75.8% or $1.3\nbillion of which have interest rates tied to LIBOR and 24.2% or $419.2 million of which have interest rates tied to SOFR.\n102",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\nDECEMBER 31, 2022\nThe Company expects to complete the process of converting its LIBOR-based loans and borrowings to an applicable benchmark\ninterest rate during 2023.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nAccounting Standards Adopted in 2022\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued guidance that removes certain separation models for convertible debt instruments and\nconvertible preferred stock that require the separation into a debt component and an equity or derivative component. Consequently, a\nconvertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, if no other features require\nbifurcation and recognition as derivatives and the convertible instrument is not issued with substantial premiums accounted for as paid-\nin capital. By removing those separation models, the interest rate of convertible debt instruments typically will be closer to the coupon\ninterest rate. The guidance also revises the derivative scope exception for contracts in an entity\u2019s own equity and improves the\nconsistency of EPS calculations. Adoption did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Standards to be Adopted in Future Periods\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued an amendment eliminating certain previously issued accounting guidance for troubled debt\nrestructurings (\u201cTDRs\u201d) and enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding refinancings, restructurings, and write-offs. Current GAAP\nprovides an exception to general recognition and measurement guidance for loan restructurings if they meet specific criteria to be\nconsidered TDRs. If a modification is a TDR, incremental expected losses are recorded in the allowance for credit losses upon\nmodification and specific disclosures are required. The new amendment eliminates the TDR recognition and measurement guidance and\nrequires the reporting entity to evaluate whether the modification represents a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan, consistent\nwith accounting for other loan modifications. The amendment also requires public business entities to disclose current-period gross\nwrite-offs by year of origination for certain financing receivables and net investments in leases. For entities that have adopted the\npreviously issued guidance amended by this update, which the Company did during the year ended December 31, 2020, this update is\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is\npermitted for entities that have adopted the previously issued guidance amended by this update. The Company is in the process of\nevaluating the impact of this guidance.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the 2020 consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2021 presentation.\nThese reclassifications had no effect on net loss reported.\nNOTE 3 - VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nThe Company has evaluated its loans, investments in unconsolidated entities, liabilities to subsidiary trusts issuing preferred\nsecurities (consisting of unsecured junior subordinated notes), securitizations, guarantees and other financial contracts in order to\ndetermine if they are variable interests in VIEs. The Company regularly monitors these legal interests and contracts and, to the extent it\nhas determined that it has a variable interest, analyzes the related entity for potential consolidation.\nConsolidated VIEs (the Company is the primary beneficiary)\n",

The primary beneficiary\ndetermination for each of these VIEs was made at each VIE\u2019s inception and is continually assessed.\nIn April 2022, the Company contributed an initial investment of $13.0 million for a 72.1% interest in Charles Street-ACRES\nFSU Student Venture, LLC (the \u201cFSU Student Venture\u201d). The FSU Student Venture, a joint venture between the Company and two\nunrelated third parties, was formed for the purpose of developing a student housing project. The FSU Student Venture was determined\nnot to be a VIE as there was sufficient equity at risk, it does not have disproportionate voting rights and its members all have the\nfollowing characteristics: (1) the power to direct activities, (2) the obligation to absorb losses and (3) the right to receive residual returns.\nHowever, the Company consolidated the FSU Student Venture due to its 72.1% interest that provides the Company with unilateral\n103",

The fair values of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities are estimated as follows:\nCRE whole loans. The fair values of the Company\u2019s loans held for investment are measured by discounting the expected future\ncash flows using the current interest rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same\nremaining maturities. Par values of loans with variable interest rates are expected to approximate fair value unless evidence of credit\ndeterioration exists, in which case the fair value approximates the par value less the loan\u2019s allowance estimated through individual\nevaluation. Fair values of loans with fixed rates are calculated using the net present values of future cash flows, discounted at market\nrates. The Company\u2019s floating-rate CRE loans had interest rates from 7.03% to 12.67% and 3.01% to 9.00% at December 31, 2022 and\n2021, respectively.\n132",

These changes in market conditions may adversely impact\nthe Company\u2019s financial performance and are referred to as \u201cmarket risks.\u201d When deemed appropriate, the Company used derivatives\nas a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company\nthrough the use of derivative instruments were interest rate risk and market price risk.\nThe Company also historically managed its interest rate risk with interest rate swaps. Interest rate swaps are contracts between\ntwo parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices.\nThe Company seeks to manage the extent to which net income changes as a function of changes in interest rates by matching\nadjustable-rate assets with variable-rate borrowings.\nThe Company classified its interest rate swap contracts as cash flow hedges, which are hedges that eliminate the risk of changes\nin the cash flows of a financial asset or liability.\nThe Company terminated all of its interest rate swap positions associated with its financed CMBS portfolio in April 2020. At\ntermination, the Company realized a loss of $11.8 million. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had losses of $6.6 million\nand $8.5 million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which will be amortized into earnings over the\nremaining life of the debt. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded amortization expense,\nreported in interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations, of $1.8 million, $1.9 million and $1.3 million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had an unrealized gain of $256,000 and $347,000, respectively, attributable to\ntwo terminated interest rate swaps in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets, to be accreted into\nearnings over the remaining life of the debt. The Company recorded accretion income, reported in interest expense on the consolidated\nstatements of operations, of $91,000, $91,000 and $92,000 into earnings during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\nThe Company\u2019s prior origination of fixed-rate CRE whole loans exposed it to market pricing risk in connection with the\nfluctuations of market interest rates. As market interest rates increase or decrease, the fair value of the fixed-rate CRE whole loans will\ndecrease or increase accordingly. In order to mitigate this market price risk, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts in\nwhich it pays a fixed rate of interest in exchange for a variable rate of interest, usually three-month LIBOR. Unrealized gains and losses\non the value of these swap contracts were recorded in other income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations. In December\n2020, these interest rate swap",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow\ntimely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management\nrecognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of\nachieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-\nbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nUnder the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have carried out an evaluation of the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation,\nour Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the\nreasonable assurance level.\nManagement\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined\nin Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting\nmay not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2022. In making this\nassessment, management used the criteria set forth in the 2013 version of the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based upon this assessment, management concluded that our\ninternal control over financial reporting is effective at December 31, 2022.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP, audited our internal control over financial reporting\nat December 31, 2022. Their report, dated March 7, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on our internal control over financial\nreporting. This report is included in this Item 9A.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n139",
